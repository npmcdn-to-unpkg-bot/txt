<a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">HireMyFriend</a>. You can check it out right now, but
first I’d like to tell you a little about why we’ve made it.</p>
<h3>#startuplife</h3>
<p>A couple of months ago a friend came to me with a problem. The startup she
worked at was imploding—as they do—and she needed to find a new job. She is a
respected designer with a whole bunch of Twitter followers and LinkedIn
connections that she could usually reach out to for leads, but in this case
couldn’t.</p>
<p>When you’re in a full-time job and need to find new work, it’s really
difficult to reach out for help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey guys, I’m looking for work as a visual designer. I’m London based and
can start from Monday”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>If you tweeted that you’d get fired!</strong> You have to have some tact; unfortunately this usually just means silence. Sneakily emailing your confidants is risky and time consuming; even updating your LinkedIn profile looks suspicious. That network you can usually rely on for favours in a time of need? Gone.</p>
<p>Over the next few months I noticed this recurring trend. <strong>My friends who work
as freelancers would blissfully tweet out their availability</strong>—which I’m more
than happy to pass around—whilst my friends in full-time jobs tip-toed around
and only revealed their career intentions in hushed whispers.</p>
<p>There would be occasional private messages: <em>“Hey, do you know anyone hiring?
Please don’t tweet about it!”</em>, and public tweets saying <em>“My friend is
looking for work”</em>, but that seems like a slow &amp; disjointed way of finding
opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>The web is revolutionising the way we look for work</strong>—and as employers, the way we find talented people to work with—but lots of people are left out of this process.</p>
<h3>A little help from our friends.</h3>
<p>We want everyone to find a job they love and we want to avoid awkward
situations in the job search process. We want to give full-time employees the
same freedom to move around that freelancers enjoy. And we want to make job
searches social.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://makeshift.io/">Makeshift</a>, we started prototyping tools to make
this a thing of the past, which brings us to today.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">HireMyFriend</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*kO6Ge2Ww7wzkvg5G.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Create a profile</strong>. It can be as vague or descriptive as you want. We’ll blur out your name and face!</p>
<p>It’s totally anonymous.</p>
<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*ZUelPFMk0uYZbILj.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Ask some friends for a helping hand</strong>. They’ll give you an endorsement and—if you ask nicely—share your profile for you.</p>
<p>You know your friend who just wrote a book that everyone is talking about? Ask
her. Or your friend who has a zillion Twitter followers? Ask him! <strong>Get people
talking!</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations from the right people will get employers excited.</p>
<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*efkA2cQPybrITLiv.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Employers get in touch</strong>. This is where you can drop your veil. We’ll filter out the sketchy recruitment agencies, and you can choose who finds out your true identity.</p>
<p>Did your current boss coincidentally get in touch? It’s a small world, but
we’ve got you covered — just reject the message and she’ll be none the wiser.</p>
<p>I’m really excited about <a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">HireMyFriend</a>. It has
already helped place people in great companies, and I’d love for you to try it
out.</p>
