There are bands that I haven’t formed, karaoke sessions I’ve messed up and Bon Jovi power ballads I haven’t rocked out to around campfires all because I can’t sing.</p>
<p>Every time I’ve sung, people have shot me down. This might literally be once every few years, but the result is that I sing incredibly rarely. The thought of singing fills me with dread, and flashbacks to people being mean when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>I recently decided enough was enough. It’s really hard to jam to proper songs in London because no one sings, so very belatedly in my mid-20s I’m…just…going…to…learn…to…sing. Even if it hurts me and my neighbours hate me.</p>
<p>That was a few weeks ago. I work from home so I’ve been singing pretty much every day. Thank god I work from home. I’m still terrible, but I’m a little tiny bit less terrible than I was a few weeks ago. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit less terrible than I am today. I’ve got some vocal lessons booked which I’m excited for, but I’m more excited to let go of the demons in my head which stop me from practising.</p>
<p>“Practice makes perfect” might be the most trite aphorism going, but in most cases it turns out it really does work. In any case, writing every day makes you a better writer - maybe I’m a tiny, tiny bit less terrible at writing now than I was five paragraphs ago.</p>
