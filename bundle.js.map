I’ve often wondered why big (enterprise?) sites have URLs that deviate from what we’d choose.</p>\\n<p>As an example, why not rewrite</p>\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7256/kw//session/L3NpZC93c2lCWHB1aw%3D%3D\\\">http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7256/kw//session/L3NpZC93c2lCWHB1aw%3D%3D</a></em></p>\\n<p>as</p>\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"http://support.logitech.com/products/v470/manuals\\\">http://support.logitech.com/products/v470/manuals</a></em></p>\\n<p>Surely it’s just a matter of appropriate routing?</p>\\n<p>I opened up that question to <a href=\\\"http://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-websites-have-unreadable-URLs\\\">Quora</a>; if you have any suggestions I’d love it if you commented here or answered on Quora.</p>\\n<p>The rest of the website was similarly horrible and unusable, it’s like they stop employing UX designers for existing customer-facing pages.</p>\\n<h3>Software</h3>\\n<p>Now to install the driver. Standard install, until I get asked this question. Bearing in mind I’m ‘installing’ a mouse. Not a keyboard. On a Mac. That has it’s own keyboard layout. I wonder if this option actually affects anything in the system or just serves to confuse users?</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Keyboard-Selection.png\\\"><img src=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Keyboard-Selection.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>With all that done, I now have to restart my Mac (I thought we left that at Windows 98?), and then go to the proprietary control panel. Why deviate from expected UI conventions? Why do I need a separate app to configure the behaviour of a scroll wheel? <em>Why can’t you be more like Apple?</em></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/V470-Bluetooth-Laser-Travel-Mouse.png\\\"><img src=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/V470-Bluetooth-Laser-Travel-Mouse.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>Maybe I’m making a big deal out of nothing, maybe there are technical limitations I’m overlooking. Or maybe I’ve come to expect beautifully thought out products from years of using Apple products. Whatever it is, I’ve spent the entire day angry at poor UX decisions that could easily be rectified.</p>\\n<p>Having products as rough around the edges as this leaves a sour taste in my mouth and makes me think Logitech just doesn’t care about me so long as they have my money.</p>\\n<p>Which is a shame, because it’s a nice mouse.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 428 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-08-01 10:09:01\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"living-the-dream-part-one\",\"status\":\"publish\",\"published\":false,\"title\":\"Living the Dream, Part One\",\"wordpress_id\":\"66\",\"categories\":[\"Prismatic\",\"San Francisco\"],\"body\":\"<p>If you’ve been following my tweets recently you’ll have noticed I’ve been waking up and going to sleep rather late. 8 hours late, actually.

It’s 3am on a Sunday night and we’ve just finished work.

But I have a\\nshiny new blog urging me to write on. So here we go, stream of\\nconciousness style.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Before I start, it’s been difficult over the years to restrain public\\nranting about Ravensbourne. What follows is a completely objective\\npost about my experience there, after the dust has had sufficient time\\nto settle; it’s more rational and less emotional than the drafts I’ve\\nwritten over the years.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>The Good.</h3>\\n<p>Learning typography in a traditional setting, from people who have been\\nthere (Basel/Zurich), done that, and kerned the t-shirt. Typesetting <em>by\\nhand, on paper</em>. Learning about grids, 1-on-1, from actual Modernists\\nwho actually knew Muller-Brockmann. <strong>Having Wim fucking Crouwel come in\\nfor an intimate lecture on your birthday</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Spending three years in a studio with classmates— laughing, joking,\\nkerning, stressing out, sticking in, cutting out, learning together\\nand <strong>teaching each other</strong>. Having older students to look up to, and\\nhaving younger students to (hopefully) pass things on to. <strong>Just being\\nin that environment for that amount of time is incredibly valuable.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>You can’t replicate that learning from home</strong> (due to the internet not\\nbeing the greatest setting for learning design), or at an\\ninternship/apprenticeship/etc (due to time constraints), but I’m not\\nsure it’s valuable enough to justify the investment.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/07/n725840617_5477295_151.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>The Bad.</h3>\\n<p><strong>Feeling like The Good Ship Web Design is sailing off without you_.\\n_<strong>Thinking you’ve had enough learning and want to start doing. Right\\nnow.</strong> Before another amazing site gets launched that you didn’t have\\nthe chance to work on.</strong> Because you’re sat in a classroom meeting\\nunproductive assessment criteria when you could be doing meaningful\\nwork. Seeing younger designers (who haven’t committed to years of\\neducation) achieve great things, and curse yourself for being stuck in\\nthis situation.</p>\\n<p>**On Sketchbooks, and ticking boxes: **of course we have to learn to\\ndesign on paper. No one disputes that. Going straight to the Mac is a\\nmistake we’re all guilty of in the early stages of our careers, and we\\ncould all stand to keep better visual scrapbooks. <strong>Sketchbooks are\\nbrilliant.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>But not when they’re a key component of assessment</strong>. I’m dyspraxic\\nand, to cut to the chase, when I’m in <strong>the zone</strong> I can’t slow down,\\nprint out what I’m doing, neatly cut it out and stick it into a\\nsketchbook, then annotate it just to show the assessors my thought\\nprocess. Not without ruining my work and focus.</p>\\n<p>Just one example.</p>\\n<p>Outdated assessment styles and disability discrimination combining to\\nmake for <strong>mediocre outcomes</strong>; just one example of how inappropriate\\nand self-serving design education has become. Nice. **If a degree has to\\nbe compromised to be shoehorned in to the national education framework\\nthen it’s not appropriate anymore. **</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/07/n725840617_5477285_8646.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Education can’t do digital.</h3>\\n<p>The problem is BA (Hons) degrees need to be validated. They need to have\\na set curriculum, with set projects and assessment criteria for those\\nprojects. Web design is moving so fast that just taking an hour out to\\nwrite this post has caused me to fall behind(!). <strong>There’s no way that\\nsomething as fast moving as web design can be shoehorned into a 3-year\\nvalidation cycle.</strong> Ish.</p>\\n<p><strong>Front-end code can’t be taught in universities.</strong> Period. It’s moving\\ntoo fast. C++ and Java can be taught, but they’re not moving at\\nbreakneck pace. <strong>Let’s forget the idea of web design education\\nrequiring a code component.</strong> I just can’t see a way it can be done. <strong>I\\nstill passionately believe that every graduating designer should know\\nhow to write HTML and CSS, but the classroom isn’t the place for it.</strong></p>\\n<p>What the classroom <strong>can</strong> teach is design for the web. User Experience\\ndesign. <strong>How to think like a web designer, rather than a print designer\\ndoing a website</strong>. Big difference. And that’s not being taught properly\\nbecause the staff aren’t in place. With such a high demand for good web\\ndesigners at the moment who would choose to teach? What you get is\\ntutors who honed their skills as print designers being told by\\nmanagement to ‘make things digital’. It doesn’t work.</p>\\n<p>But that’s the only hope I can see for design education - <strong>have\\nrelevant tutors teaching relevant design, or die</strong>.</p>\\n<h3>The Outcome.</h3>\\n<p>Things worked out for me in the end, but I wonder if it was directly a\\nresult of design education as a system, or a combination of chances on\\nthe side. One example is if Ravensbourne hadn’t scrapped its analog\\nfacilities (screenprinting, letterpress, darkroom) I would have been\\ncontent making posters. Without these facilities I became jaded with\\nprint design which led me to web design. <strong>In a roundabout,\\nunintentional way, my education made me a web designer.</strong></p>\\n<p>But that’s just my story - knowing what I know now, I don’t think I\\ncould recommend any design course apart from <a href=\\\"http://www.hyperisland.se/\\\">Hyper\\nIsland</a>. Possibly some of the <a href=\\\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/\\\">UAL\\ncolleges</a> if you’re intent on being a print\\ndesigner at the end of it but** so was I**.</p>\\n<h3>‘But I want to be a print designer!’</h3>\\n<p>In 3 years I’m sure the web will be even a more attractive prospect than\\nit is today, and I think you’d be foolish to not pursue a career in\\ndigital design.** Seriously. It’s awesome.**</p>\\n<h3>What are the other options?</h3>\\n<p>Try to find a job somewhere that will teach you the ropes. Not an agency\\nstill creating Flash or tables. Apprenticeships like <a href=\\\"http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/want-to-be-our-apprentice\\\">Mark\\nBoulton</a>\\nwas offering are a great idea. I don’t have the answers yet, but I do\\nknow that design school shouldn’t be the best one. I really hope some\\nday we can solve this problem, because there <strong>are</strong> positives to formal\\ndesign education. I’m just incredibley jaded by my experiences.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 431 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-09-15 08:58:12\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"on-windows-8\",\"status\":\"publish\",\"title\":\"On Windows 8\",\"wordpress_id\":\"159\",\"body\":\"<p>This is a post I thought I’d never write. I just installed the <a href=\\\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516\\\">developer preview</a> of Windows 8 and really like it.</p>\\n<p>The thing is, Windows 8 is a very impressive operating system. Shockingly good, if you consider the low standard we expect from Microsoft. <strong>Metro is utterly gorgeous</strong>. I fundamentally disagree with Apple’s descent into skeumorphism. I disagree with the principles behind it and the way I see their interfaces going in the next 5-10 years. On the other hand <strong>Metro is fresh and bold</strong>, but most importantly it looks like something one of my favourite designers would have created. <strong>It’s straight out of 1960s Switzerland</strong>, but rather than falling into the trap of being too flat and too rigid an interpretation of 60s Modernism, the whole thing feels clickable, touchable and interactable. It’s a balance I’ve struggled with for as long as I’ve been designing interfaces, so I can appreciate the solution they’ve presented.</p>\\n<p>It neatly avoids the trap that Apple and Android UIs have fallen into - hinting at depth is fine, but descending into a clusterfuck of of faux-leather textures, glossy buttons and redundant metaphors is taking it too far.</p>\\n<h3>But wasn’t Windows Phone 7 a bit shit?</h3>\\n<p>Yup. I’ve admired Metro for a while, but found it to be too ambitious for a smartphone. It just feels cluttered on a 4&quot; screen. Or maybe it was just badly implemented. <strong>There was a huge disparity from looking at the beautiful screenshots and actually using it.</strong> What does this mean for WP7? That’s not within the scope of this blogpost. On a 10&quot; tablet though, with more room to let the design breathe? <strong>This could be a serious competitor for the ‘lounging on the sofa checking Twitter’ category.</strong></p>\\n<h3>What about Aero?</h3>\\n<p>I can appreciate a juggernaut like Microsoft being afraid of alienating users with a rapid change of direction. I don’t like it, but I can appreciate their business goals. I think there will have to be some future iteration of Windows with Aero in it. <strong>But I don’t see the dual-interface thing working out well for them - it presents too many compromises in hardware performance and interface usability</strong>. It shows that Microsoft didn’t learn from a decade of unsellable ‘tablet’ devices. With that said, Aero does look a little nicer than on Windows 7. Perhaps they should release an updated Aero as Windows 7.5.</p>\\n<h3>Bi-interfacing ≠ #winning.</h3>\\n<p>Switching between two interfaces just isn’t going to work. Not for a tablet OS. Click targets and tap targets are too different.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/metro\\\">Gruber made an interesting point the other day</a> - perhaps on desktop you’ll have both Metro and Aero; on tablet devices just Metro. That would be fantastic. I wouldn’t use a desktop version of Windows any time soon, but in the event that they really nailed the tablet ecosystem I could see myself trading my iPad for a Windows tablet for casual use.</p>\\n<p>If they get rid of Aero on tablets they’ll have a shot at producing cheap, light tablets with modest hardware and excellent battery life.</p>\\n<h3>So you think Microsoft is going to whoop Apple’s ass?</h3>\\n<p>Nope. My spidey-sense is telling me <strong>Microsoft is organisationally incapable of doing anything exceptional</strong>. They’ve hired some fantastic designers but I just don’t see them working as a team to create a great product. The design teams are only a tiny blip in MSFT’s organisational structure, and there are too many potential conflicts of interest that will prevent them from creating a beautiful and pure OS. <strong>Godforbid they make a Metro-style Ribbon…</strong></p>\\n<p>The other reason is fragmentation. Without a full-stack offering to compete with Apple (or soon, Google-Motorola) it will still be Windowsy. <strong>Things will still break</strong>. Asian OEMs will still release shitty hardware, and that shitty hardware will work like shit with Windows 8.</p>\\n<p>Let’s not forget why we made (and enjoyed) the switch to Macs -** it wasn’t that OS9/X was prettier than Windows** (arguably the first few iterations of OSX were ugly as sin compared to the more restrained XP) - <strong>it was that Macs just worked</strong>, and we were sick of .dll files, registry entries and things breaking on PCs.</p>\\n<p><strong>And that’s the most important thing Apple still has going for it, because they can’t rely on their interfaces any more.</strong></p>\\n<p>—</p>\\n<p>If you have Windows 8 installed I’d love to know your thoughts in the comments!</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 432 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-10-26 18:13:56\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"burgers-tablets-typography\",\"status\":\"publish\",\"title\":\"Burgers, Tablets & Typography\",\"published\":true,\"body\":\"<p>If there’s one thing I love more than talking about technology and looking at typefaces, it’s burgers.

The In-N-Out Principle at work again. A 7&quot; iPad would dilute the value of the 9.7&quot; iPad. Different sizes suggest different use cases - a 7&quot; iPad wouldn’t be different enough to the 9.7&quot; iPad to warrant different applications, context and mindset.

Let’s go back to graphic design. I’ve been meaning to write an article about the principles behind good grid systems for a while now.</p>\\n<p>In the same way as fewer burgers to choose from helps us make a decision and fill our stomach with meaty goodness, fewer possible combinations of grid units make each one stronger.</p>\\n<p>The simplified layouts below take the same basic shape  - using a more rigid grid with less flexibility makes for a more tense layout; increasing options makes the whole thing more sloppy.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-01.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-02.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>And an example with more representative content - again the beauty of a grid (unity, contrast and tension) is lost with an increasing number of decreasingly significant options for content placement.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-04.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-03.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Again, I’m not suggesting that we should always stick to 4 column grids, but when you start your next project make sure you consider the implications and relevance of the grid you’re working with. Less is often more.</p>\\n<h3>Surely you can’t make typography about burgers too?</h3>\\n<p>You bet! This is the big one. I’ve been <a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/2011/10/calendar/\\\">offering little tidbits of design advice</a> to early-stage startups and aspiring designers recently, and one thing that keeps coming up is refining typography. Not a huge overhaul, not the Swiss ‘kerning tiny bits of paper by hand’ exercises we were forced to do in design school (more on that another time) - just little tweaks and principles that make a world of difference. How? Limiting options, of course!</p>\\n<p>Creating and sticking to a strict type scale is a great first step. Limit the options of typefaces and weights. One typeface in one weight in one size can be effective; two weights, typefaces and sizes is fine. But using 5 typefaces on a site, in an inconsistent range of sizes and every weight they come in? You’re back to McDonalds again.</p>\\n<p>In Josef Müller-Brockmann’s seminal book ‘<a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grid-Systems-Graphic-Design-Typographers/dp/3721201450/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319646813&amp;sr=8-5\\\">Grid Systems in Graphic Design</a>’ there’s a brilliant illustration of this concept - if you don’t own the book then I highly recommend it.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/Grid-Systems-1.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Of course this principle isn’t just applicable to graphic design, tablet computers and beefburgers - in almost any field or application, limiting choice makes each option stronger by itself and stronger as the sum of parts.</p>\\n<p>And next time you’re in California, stop by In-N-Out.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 433 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-10-03 12:31:19\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"calendar\",\"published\":false,\"title\":\"Opening up my calendar\",\"wordpress_id\":\"167\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve freed up ~an hour/day in my calendar to help advise early-stage startups and young designers — <a href=\\\"http://officehours.tv/\\\">Office Hours</a> style.

That every new Apple app should be doused in texture. That the brand-new iTunes Movie Trailers app should be draped in red velvet curtains, with crushed popcorn scattered around.</p>\\n<p>That would be nice and familiar for users, wouldn’t it?</p>\\n<p>Of course not.</p>\\n<p>Apple can and did build a better application in this case by avoiding the obvious metaphors and just <em>making a good app</em>.</p>\\n<p>It can be done.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/itunes_movie_trailers_ipad.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Neat! What other metaphors are broken?</h3>\\n<p>Newspapers and magazines. The first wave of iPad newspaper apps was a skeuomorphic shitstorm. Accidentally picking up the print edition of The Metro ruins my morning commute, but <a href=\\\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/metro-tablet-edition/id463429891?mt=8\\\">the iPad version</a> is infinitely worse. I get it. You like your columns and smudged ink. You don’t want to put any design thought into this newfangled iPad business. Laziness won’t win you any friends.</p>\\n<p>In contrast, the newly released Guardian app is brilliantly un-skeuomorphic. There are no <a href=\\\"http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/wired-on-ipad-just-like-a-paper-tiger/\\\">for-the-sake-of-it columns</a>, no <a href=\\\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-early-edition/id363496943?mt=8\\\">blackletter mastheads</a>, just a clean grid and perfect typography. I think it’s a huge improvement over the vast majority of iOS news-delivery apps. As a vehicle for branded periodical content (as opposed to an aggregator such as Reeder) it might be the most forward-thinking app <em>period.</em></p>\\n<p>The Guardian <em>get it.</em></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/IMG_0050.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>And then Apple fuck it all up.</h3>\\n<p>Newsstand is a problem. Having a single collection for all branded periodical content is awesome and useful. Having a single location for purchasing those apps is also awesome. Forcing that content into <em>another</em> outdated metaphor—in this case a wooden shelf of printed media—is wrong. Especially when lots of the content (e.g. the Guardian) is pushing past that metaphor to create new, unique, and appropriate experiences.</p>\\n<p>The Guardian app breaks past the page/paper/column metaphor. Newsstand tries to neatly shovel it back into the days of print. For familiarity. <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk\\\">Familiarity that won’t be present in the very near future</a>. It completely ignores the design direction the Guardian team have taken.</p>\\n<p><strong>It takes the easy way out, and as designers we don’t believe in easy.</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/IMG_0053.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Yesterday’s News</h3>\\n<p>The transition from daily print newspapers to daily iPad news(~papers) has been uninspired. In the age of Twitter it seems ridiculous to wait for your news - breaking news is now instant; confirmed reporting and reaction comes within minutes and hours. By the time print newspapers report on the story it seems quaint and backwards. Old news.</p>\\n<p>Over the past few days there’s been great discussion on Twitter about the place of the Guardian app - whether it is a step backwards or forwards, and whether we need daily editions of yesterday’s news at all. Miles Cheverton hits some great points in <a href=\\\"http://thetalldesigner.com/blog/2011/10/15/the-last-spasms-of-a-dying-business-model-why-the-guardian-ipad-app-is-a-step-into-the-past/\\\">The Last Spasms of a Dying Business Model</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>[The Guardian] is trying to fit an old media paradigm (the daily print) into a world where days don’t really exist, into a world where we can update things as they happen, in a world where you can write an article about a terrorist attack as soon as it happens in 6 words, extend it to 6 paragraphs an hour later and extend that to a 6 section in depth analysis. None of the possibilities and advantages of working with a fast, constantly connected smart media device are used, even when doing so would be cheaper.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>And I absolutely agree with this. I agreed with it so much that I wrote 10 000 words arguing the same thing for my dissertation a year ago. But then the Saturday edition of the paper landed (automatically) in my Newsstand this morning. And then I changed my mind about this particular metaphor. Kind of.</p>\\n<h3>Branded content is nice.</h3>\\n<p>It’s nice reading content by the Guardian. They’re a brand I trust, whether in print, on the web or online.</p>\\n<h3>A curated collection of content is nice.</h3>\\n<p>I appreciate the Guardian’s curation of content - being able to flick through relevant things that I might otherwise miss on my strict diet of only reading articles linked to by John Gruber. Whilst they have _every_thing on their website, it’s nice to just be shown <em>some</em> things. Just the things that matter today.</p>\\n<h3>It doesn’t have to compete with instant.</h3>\\n<p>In the same way that the weekend newspapers are a more leisurely, editorial discussion rather than break-neck to-the-minute reporting, I see a future in ‘trusted news sources’ providing that editorial discussion. Realtime is great, but if you’re adamant that a daily edition is good then make it interesting stuff we haven’t read rather than what we read as it happened yesterday.</p>\\n<h3>Cognitive dissonance, Jon?</h3>\\n<p>Not really. Two different metaphors. The visual metaphor and the daily edition metaphor. The issue I care most about is ridding the world of me-too skeumorphic monstrosities. I care that future apps for finding my friends don’t look like a thrifted leather jacket, and I care that future digital content delivery mechanisms don’t look like print newspapers.</p>\\n<p>The Guardian app doesn’t look like print, it looks like the future. The content could do with <strong>either</strong> being realtime <strong>or</strong> focussing more on editorials, but for now the fact that it specifically doesn’t look like its print edition is enough for me.</p>\\n<p><strong>The priority for us as visual designers should be to out-innovate skeuomorphism - not just for ourselves, but for the next generation.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>The ones who will never pick up a printed newspaper or magazine.</strong></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 435 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-11-26 17:42:51\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"published\":true,\"title\":\"I bought a Lumia (the £500 blog post)\",\"body\":\"<p>It’s no secret that I’ve been growing frustrated with Apple recently. Their trend of <a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/2011/10/the-metaphors-breaking-the-future/\\\">skeuomorphism</a> is alienating me as a designer and making me question the future of their products. I’ve been interested in the direction <a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/2011/09/on-windows-8/\\\">Microsoft</a> are taking for a while, though until now there haven’t really been any killer devices to take advantage of it yet. So I’ve stuck with my iPhone. I think this is all going to change with the brand new Nokia Lumia 800 - a high end, beautifully designed phone that really does the Windows Phone 7 operating system justice.</p>\\n<p>Actually, I was so curious about the Lumia that I spent £470 of my own money on one to put it through its paces. I should probably just ask for a review copy in future. But hey, I have a great phone and I want to tell you all about it!</p>\\n<p>I’m not great at writing tech reviews, and over the past few drafts this post has taken all different formats. Perhaps the best way is to just note down some thoughts and then open up for questions and discussion in the comments? I’m happy to answer anything, try out apps, take screenshots or check your websites are rendering properly.</p>\\n<p>So in no particular order, my thoughts on the Lumia 800.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6361236563_f470101502.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"P1060881.jpg\\\"></p>\\n<p>The hardware is a stroke of genius - after every generation of the iPhone it’s surely the nicest phone on the market. It’s actually comfier to hold that an iPhone without the bargain-bin tackiness of Android devices. Really sensational, and I’ve been getting a lot of comments about it. One of the only bad bits about the hardware is the screen - it’s an AMOLED PenTile and every bit as bad as the Androids with similar panels. It warps colours and distorts images, and really puts me off developing for the device.</p>\\n<p>The other thing is battery. The majority of my second day with the Lumia was spent without it - I forgot to charge it overnight and apparently my MacBook Pro doesn’t provide enough juice to charge it. Neither does a 240V iPad wall charger. So I had to wait until I got home to use the Nokia charger. Sidenote - but in the intervening hours (not realising what was wrong with it) I’d tried hard resetting the phone to get it to boot up. So I lost all my data because of the shitty power management. Oops!</p>\\n<p>Describing what’s great about this device keeps coming back to <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)\\\">Metro</a> though. Metro - Microsoft’s new visual language - is absolutely breathtaking. Metro makes <em>almost all</em> apps look fantastic, not just those by A-list developers. The UI elements are gorgeous, the animations are gorgeous and the icons are gorgeous. The phone, as I’ve mentioned before and as <em>everyone who sees it</em> remarks is also gorgeous.</p>\\n<p>The Twitter app is beautiful. The Spotify app is beautiful. All of the apps are beautiful. Perhaps I’m overly keen to like Metro, but it seems like a solid framework for good apps. With the trend towards skeuomorphism I’m more worried about the legacy of apps designed outside the still-talented towers of Cupertino. With UI guidelines as strong as Metro I’d hope everyone will be producing aesthetically beautiful apps. Time will tell.</p>\\n<p>The scroll physics are generally great - not as perfect as iOS, but infinitely better than the jarring, jerky, strobe physics of Android. This is a huge coup for Nokia - if only because it kills dead Android’s argument that fragmentation means you can’t optimise for smooth scrolling. Nokia have done, and it makes the device a pleasure to use.</p>\\n<p>What lets it down is ecosystem. Not the Zune/Xbox Live ecosystem—I’ve only ever had bad experiences buying media through the iTunes Store—rather just the <em>feeling</em> of using the device. <a href=\\\"http://thenextweb.com/author/matthewpanzarino/\\\">Matthew Panzarino</a> points to the lack of quality apps in his review, which is definitely something I noticed. Everything you’d expect (Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, 1Password, WordPress etc) is there, but there are none of the gems that make iOS a delight to use. TweetBot, Reeder, Instapaper, OmniFocus are sorely missed, and I could never consider giving up my iPhone without decent replacements for them. Pretty typography in apps seemingly doesn’t make them good. D’oh!</p>\\n<p>Bing Maps is awful and unreadable. It’s a shame, especially considering how much richer Android is as a platform for its superior maps. But that’s not a WP7 problem - it’s a Microsoft problem.</p>\\n<p>There’s no way to take screenshots on this device. <em>There’s no way to take screenshots on this device</em>. Seriously? There’s <a href=\\\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=14076592\\\">this hack</a>, but it seems like a bit of a cludge. Come on guys, I have a blog full of people I want to show the beautiful interface to!</p>\\n<p>Having all of your social media accounts baked into the phone is a nice touch - the system level integration with Facebook that lets me see my girlfriend’s photos on the same card as her phone number and email address is great.</p>\\n<p>The Lumia seems to support the latest and greatest in web standards - one painful example for designers is the lack of Helvetica on the device, so either embed it with @font-face or get used to seeing lots of Arial! Media queries have been fine in my testing - as with web fonts, if you want me to test anything please let me know in the comments.</p>\\n<p>When asked how I like the device I keep catching myself prefixing the review with ‘actually, surprisingly, it’s really nice!’. Not ‘it’s really nice’. But a patronising semi-excuse. And this is the problem with Microsoft and Nokia. They might have produced a fantastic product but at least on this occasion it will not be viewed on a level playing field. Remember rooting for the underdog North Korean football (<em>soccer</em>) team during the 2010 World Cup? That’s this.</p>\\n<p>The flip side is I have to keep questioning myself and what I believe in. Cellphones should not prompt an existential crisis. It’s just a phone. But I keep having to ask myself whether I want Apple to win, or I want <em>better</em> to win. As a designer I hope I always go for better. Metro is undeniably gorgeous but I still can’t form an objective opinion about whether the phone as a whole is good enough to replace my iPhone.</p>\\n<p>The facts say it’s good enough. My heart says no.</p>\\n<p>I just can’t rationalise living outside of the Apple safety net. 80% of the population probably can, and will love a phone that <em>smokes</em> Android.</p>\\n<p><em>I’m going to be auctioning off the Lumia when I’ve finished having a play with it, with any profits going to Movember.

You might be familiar with the <a href=\\\"http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas\\\">Business Model Canvas</a> (a visual grid for describing and iterating on business models); the Validation Board is a similar idea for earlier stage exploration. It’s a really neat way to note down your Hypotheses and  Assumptions at each step of the process, and keep track of the work you’ve done. I found using the Validation Board invaluable in two areas - it helped crystallise our team’s thinking, and it allowed wandering mentors and friends to understand our progress quickly and easily. 5-7 words per post-it note, all uppercase, no rambling. Boom!</p>\\n<p>You can <a href=\\\"http://leanstartupmachine.com/validationboard/\\\">download a Validation Board for free online</a> as a PDF and Keynote template, but consider taking it to a print shop and getting an A1 print to stick on your wall. Also take some time to watch the videos on the site - they go some way to explaining how it should be used.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2012/10/ValidationBoard.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Our ValidationBoard\\\"></p>\\n<p>Before this weekend I wondered what people <strong>actually do</strong> at a Lean Startup Machine course - I knew there was no hacking or designing involved, but I couldn’t picture ‘talking to customers’. Would we be roleplaying? Would a mentor stand on stage and just tell us theoretical teachings? Hell no! <strong>The weekend revolved around getting out of the building</strong> (physically and metaphorically). ‘Get Out Of The Building’ is a synonym for ‘Getting Out of Your Head’ - it turned out phoning contacts and conducting online qualitative &amp; quantitative research was ‘out of the building’ too.</p>\\n<p>But I digress - <strong>actually getting out of the building and talking to real strangers was hugely valuable to me.</strong> I definitely have a tendency to bottle up ideas and wait until they’re ‘perfect’ to unleash them on the world - no more!.</p>\\n<p>Our initial idea was a ‘platform for sci-fi fans to get involved with the production of movies’. <strong>Kickstarter meets GitHub. In space.</strong> A way for fans to cut through blockbuster disappointment and get the movies <strong>they wanted</strong> produced. This worked out quite well for the exercise - sci-fi fans are a very targeted demographic and this allowed us to pin them down to some quite specific geographic locations. So first thing on Saturday morning we went to the ‘scene of the customer’ —Forbidden Planet in Soho—and talked to some customers!</p>\\n<p>We learnt a few things that morning:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Speaking to strangers isn’t so scary once you get into it.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://dex.io/robfitz/how-to-screw-up-custdev/\\\">Asking non-leading questions</a> is really difficult.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The people we talked to hated our idea.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Know when’s the time to pitch your ideas to people - you learn a lot more by <em>listening</em> rather than <em>talking</em>.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>From this initial invalidation we picked up on some great insights from our customers - they were mainly happy with the selection of media available, but lots had friends producing low-budget horror—not sci-fi—films. Ketchup and a MiniDV camera, that sort of thing. These friends supposedly had a tough time getting their films heard about online, which we thought was a shame, so <strong>we decided to pull our first pivot and talk to some filmmakers.</strong> Surely they’d love our new idea of a social media marketing &amp; analytics tool?</p>\\n<p>One of the things every team was worried about this was <strong>‘where do we find customers to talk to at the weekend?’</strong>. In the real world we have days and weeks to track down people to talk to, but we had to move ultra-fast and iterate several times over a weekend. Answer? You’ll figure it out, trust me.</p>\\n<p>Scouring Facebook, Twitter &amp; LinkedIn, wracking our brains and breaking into a film school (seriously) we found ~20 filmmakers eager to talk to us about their craft. We were convinced they’d love our social media idea (though again we weren’t pitching it to them - rather seeing if they’d validate our assumptions). Again a resounding rejection - a vast majority of them pointed out that they had to keep their work <strong>offline</strong> so it was eligible for film festivals - the major events that they were worried about. <strong>Pivot again</strong>, this wasn’t working.</p>\\n<p>Talking to more filmmakers we found out that whilst film festivals are important, after the festivals lots of films fail to find their way to an audience. Our final idea - <strong>a service to let fans watch independent films that otherwise wouldn’t be made available.</strong> A two-sided market, we also envisaged it as a <strong>platform for filmmakers to gain leverage and social proof to showcase their work to independent cinemas</strong> in the hopes of bringing them back to the silver screen. The filmmakers and film festival organisers we spoke to were unanimously keen on this idea (some even rushing to send us trailers and information to use) - which we took as validation. Running out of time in the weekend, we also decided to put up a landing page to gauge whether fans would sign up.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://underdogfilms.co\\\">It’s not the prettiest site</a> I’ve hacked\\ntogether but for an hour’s work (and treating it just as part of the\\nprocess &amp; learning experience) we felt it did a great job - £75 of\\nAdWords, a couple of tweets and several hundred visitors later it’s\\nstill maintaining a <strong>17% conversion rate</strong>. Better than the 3% conversion rate we’d hoped for!</p>\\n<p>Overall a fantastic weekend - I met some fantastic people (participants,\\nmentors and the customers we spoke to!) and <strong>learnt more in 48 hours</strong> than I thought possible. There’s definitely more we could have done at every stage, but I’m glad we didn’t obsess on detail and instead moved quickly through the process - there’s time to conduct really thorough experiments in the real world!</p>\\n<p>Top things I learnt this weekend</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Don’t hold onto ideas too tightly</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>(In)validate your assumptions</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Talk to real people, not your friends &amp; parents!</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I had a fantastic time and would recommend it to anyone (the crowd was surprisingly diverse - not the usual homogeneity of designers &amp; developers). The next London workshop is taking place in <a href=\\\"http://leanstartupmachine.com/events/london-december-14-16/\\\">December</a> (and the team put on events all around the world) - I hope you get out of it as much as I did!</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 439 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"layout\":\"post\",\"title\":\"New Adventures\",\"date\":\"2013-01-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"body\":\"<p>I’m notoriously bad at publishing my thoughts after conferences—I have a #buildconf essay spanning two conferences and 17 months of faffing and drafting—so I thought I’d post something about New Adventures while the memories (and hangover) are still fresh.</p>\\n<p>I’m totally addicted to Branch at the moment so I <a href=\\\"http://branch.com/g/new-adventures\\\">made a group to chat about each of the talks</a>. Would love to have you in the group talking about the day — send a request to join :)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/jason-the-nimble-process\\\">Jason Santa Maria</a> talked about process. We’re well past the stage where we should be going off into a Design Cave™ and come out the other end with a pixel-perfect ‘painting of a website’; we need to adapt our workflow to iterations. We need to learn how to ship great work consistently; there’s a tension between being a perfectionist and having consistent iteration cycles. I always thought it was weird how the engineers in our startups work to an Agile process but we sometimes add on a ‘waterfall’ layer of design before that.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/tyler-appropriate-tension\\\">Tyler Mincey</a> spoke about his time at Apple working with some amazing inter-disciplinary teams and how we get the best work done working with others. Great insight into the dynamics of the best teams.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/michael-the-inertia-of-ideas\\\">Michael Heilemann</a> did a quick talk on doing work you want to be doing. The stuff you do in your spare time is the stuff you should be doing 9-5.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/tiago-responsive-teaching\\\">Tiago Pedras</a> made me want to be a teacher. Since I graduated I’ve had mixed feelings about design education. I’m really glad I learnt to kern from old Swiss dudes with white beards, but my uni didn’t prepare me at all for the work I’m doing now. That’s cool, I <em>learnt to learn</em>. I often find myself thinking designers should be taught to <em>design</em> in uni rather than how to be <em>web</em> designers because of the fluidity of our industry and the pace of change, but people like Tiago and Chris Murphy are exciting me about what we can do if we stop trying to adapt graphic design courses to the digital era and instead tailor courses from the ground up to be representative of the industry. Anyway, bigger blog post for another time. If any design schools want a guest lecturer with a rad moustache and an equal penchant for Akzidenz Grotesk and JavaScript, [get in touch](mailto: <a href=\\\"mailto:icanspeak@designedbygold.com\\\">icanspeak@designedbygold.com</a>).</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/jon-billboards-and-novels\\\">Jon Tan</a> got me excited about typography all over again. Great talk and some really insightful (but easy to understand) scientific research on readability &amp; aesthetics mixed in with gifs of elephants on trampolines. Want to finish writing this post so I can go and kern something.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/seb-new-adventures-in-code\\\">Seb Lee-Delisle</a> made everyone in the audience want to code. Brilliant and engaging talk (with live coding on a Commodore64 and in JS!); also great insight into the power of being a hybrid (something I’m very passionate about) and doing work you want to do. Would love to do one of his <a href=\\\"http://seb.ly/training\\\">training courses</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/steph-the-beauty-in-the-impermanent\\\">Steph Troeth</a> spoke about Wabi-Sabi and looking to make our work adapt to an era of impermanence. The stuff we do is in constant flux; an iteration might only be live for a few weeks, or we might have a CMS dealing with 5 years of content. Our work should get better with age and we should adapt to change.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/wayne-wayne-tells-it-like-it-is\\\">Wayne Hemingway</a> gave a hilarious account of how he got rich by taking risks, standing up for what he believes in, and banning French people from his events.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/wayne-wayne-tells-it-like-it-is\\\">Jessica Hische</a> was a great way to finish off the day (and to close New Adventures for good?). Similar in tone to Michael’s talk earlier in the day, Jessica was talking about doing the work we love to do (and that people will pay us to do!). Made me realise how lucky we are to be able to do stuff we love every day; this industry is amazing. Also talking about side-projects, burn-out, balance, inspiration and cats.</p>\\n<p>Rad, so those were the talks. I need to finish this post so I can design something, brain exploding with awesomeness just thinking about yesterday (and flashbacks of the past few years).</p>\\n<p>A couple of other points…</p>\\n<p><strong>Women in tech.</strong> I’ve always thought #naconf has had a great demographic mix (especially compared to other conferences); this year there were noticeably even more women there than years past. This is good news; this is progress. Anecdotally, my girlfriend reported having to queue for the toilets for the first time ever at a web conference so I guess there are downsides. Anyway…</p>\\n<p>On a personal note, New Adventures has been a hugely important part of my career and my development as a designer. The first one in 2011 was the first time I met lots of the people I’m lucky enough to call friends and colleagues now, and the first time I really felt part of the web design community. The events have always been excellent, and if this is the last one then they’ve definitely gone out on a high. Colly and Greg — if you’ve bothered to read this far down; thanks guys :)</p>\\n<p>Last thing — there was a bit of an incident involving two men, a piano and a hefty repair bill.

The startup she\\nworked at was imploding—as they do—and she needed to find a new job. She is a\\nrespected designer with a whole bunch of Twitter followers and LinkedIn\\nconnections that she could usually reach out to for leads, but in this case\\ncouldn’t.</p>\\n<p>When you’re in a full-time job and need to find new work, it’s really\\ndifficult to reach out for help.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Hey guys, I’m looking for work as a visual designer. I’m London based and\\ncan start from Monday”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><strong>If you tweeted that you’d get fired!</strong> You have to have some tact; unfortunately this usually just means silence. Sneakily emailing your confidants is risky and time consuming; even updating your LinkedIn profile looks suspicious. That network you can usually rely on for favours in a time of need? Gone.</p>\\n<p>Over the next few months I noticed this recurring trend. <strong>My friends who work\\nas freelancers would blissfully tweet out their availability</strong>—which I’m more\\nthan happy to pass around—whilst my friends in full-time jobs tip-toed around\\nand only revealed their career intentions in hushed whispers.</p>\\n<p>There would be occasional private messages: <em>“Hey, do you know anyone hiring?\\nPlease don’t tweet about it!”</em>, and public tweets saying <em>“My friend is\\nlooking for work”</em>, but that seems like a slow &amp; disjointed way of finding\\nopportunities.</p>\\n<p><strong>The web is revolutionising the way we look for work</strong>—and as employers, the way we find talented people to work with—but lots of people are left out of this process.</p>\\n<h3>A little help from our friends.</h3>\\n<p>We want everyone to find a job they love and we want to avoid awkward\\nsituations in the job search process. We want to give full-time employees the\\nsame freedom to move around that freelancers enjoy. And we want to make job\\nsearches social.</p>\\n<p>At <a href=\\\"http://makeshift.io/\\\">Makeshift</a>, we started prototyping tools to make\\nthis a thing of the past, which brings us to today.</p>\\n<p>Introducing <a href=\\\"http://hiremyfriend.io/\\\">HireMyFriend</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*kO6Ge2Ww7wzkvg5G.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Create a profile</strong>.

They’ll give you an endorsement and—if you ask nicely—share your profile for you.</p>\\n<p>You know your friend who just wrote a book that everyone is talking about? Ask\\nher.

Ask him! <strong>Get people\\ntalking!</strong></p>\\n<p>Recommendations from the right people will get employers excited.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*efkA2cQPybrITLiv.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Employers get in touch</strong>.

At Makeshift my involvement with new product prototyping has slowed down as we focus on growing our existing products; the team of generalist hackers slowly giving way to talented specialists. That’s the nature of startup teams, though.

At least in the short term I’ll be doing freelance design &amp; development - hopefully with small startups where I can add the most value.</p>\\n<p>The timing couldn’t be better. In the past few months it seems like all of my talented friends have left their full-time jobs in search of the freedom freelancing brings. The London product design scene has become close knit over the past year and this is a great time to collaborate with people I’ve wanted to work with for ages. I suspect there will be lots of shared projects, knowledge, and most importantly, beers.</p>\\n<p>I’ll also be setting aside time to build my own products. It’s been super gratifying seeing real people get real jobs through <a href=\\\"http://hiremyfriend.io\\\">Hire my Friend</a>; since we started building it last June I’ve had a bunch of other ideas I’ve been desperate to build but that I could neither do justice working on in the evenings nor fit into Makeshift’s product roadmap. That’s all going to change - there will be some exciting new bits of internet coming soon and I’m excited to share them with you.</p>\\n<h2>Available for websites, apps, conferences, weddings &amp; bar mitzvahs.</h2>\\n<p>Business time. You can hire me for design and front-end, Ruby, JavaScript &amp; iOS development. I’ve been doing lots of early-stage product design &amp; development recently—if you need help getting an MVP out the door, I could be your guy—but am equally up for doing new things around data visualisation, experimental interfaces and just good old fashioned graphic design!</p>\\n<p>I’ll have some availability in May, and am wide-open from June onwards; <a href=\\\"mailto:hire@designedbygold.com\\\">say hi and let’s make things happen</a>. I’m not looking to jump back into a full-time job immediately, but would love to hear from you if you think I’d be a good fit for your company anyway.</p>\\n<p>Rad, I think that’s all.

That discussion begs the question, if not static then what?\\nThere’s a wide range of ‘CMS’ options out there from database-driven solutions like WordPress and Drupal to static site generators like Jekyll and Middleman. WordPress and Drupal can be easy for clients to update once they are set up, but there is a ton of associated overhead. Jekyll and Middleman are dead simple, but require some knowledge of command line and markdown to redeploy after making changes.\\nWhen dealing with clients building stuff like landing and marketing pages what is your preferred solution? What’s the perfect balance between usability for the client and ease of development?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A better CMS, I think. I really don’t know the answer, but I want to kill myself working with WordPress or Drupal - so whilst the client might enjoy the editing interface, they won’t be getting a website to edit because they won’t have a web designer by that point.</p>\\n<p>Jekyll is fantastic but obviously it’s not perfect for non-technical users. Things like <a href=\\\"http://Prose.io\\\">Prose.io</a> are cool but they still don’t tell the whole story - they’re great for editing <em>text</em> but CMS’s aren’t just about editing text - they’re about reviewing drafts and installing plugins and doing <em>adminy stuff</em> - letting people feel like they’re in control.</p>\\n<p>I don’t think Jekyll is great because it’s a static site generator - it’s great because it has a sane API, where the alternatives have mindnumbingly awful APIs. I’d keep an eye on Ghost and Buckets - I don’t think the CMS is dead, just that the incumbents are shitshows.</p>\\n<p>The caveat is the death of CMSs for small, personal sites for technical owners. Remember years ago when every designers’ portfolio site was a sprawling WordPress/Drupal/Joomla/PHP Nuke/Mambo/kill-me-now mess? Every post was a database entry in a MySQL database you had no idea how anything really worked and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ALL YOU WANTED TO DO WAS LOOP OVER SOME IMAGES?

They’re both effective, but care should be taken when mixing them.</p>\\n<h2>Sandcastles</h2>\\n<p>Sandcastles are great for prototyping ideas. Whether it’s a weekend hackathon project, an afternoon messing around in a REPL, or a two week ‘JFDI’ sprint, it’s really powerful to be able to just get things out of your head, into a browser and in front of users.</p>\\n<p>The CSS may be gross, the errors not handled and Ruby a little janky, but if you’re clear about <strong>why</strong> you’re hacking, hacking is a great tool to have.

Sandcastles don’t mind when they get washed away by the tide at the end of the day.</p>\\n<p>Everything we built at <a href=\\\"http://makeshift.io\\\">Makeshift</a> started out in this way - a hack that we built quickly and showed to users as soon as possible.</p>\\n<h2>Skyscrapers</h2>\\n<p>That’s not to say that all products should start out as hacks. <em>Actually building things properly</em> also has it’s place. This is a weird paragraph to write, actually — I didn’t think I’d ever have to justify writing good code. But yeah. Some things you have to build properly to start with. Everything else should really end up being built properly <em>eventually</em>. There comes a point where you actually need things tested. You need modular, reusable code - a codebase that Google won’t laugh at when they inevitably acquihire you.</p>\\n<p>And it’s that transition between the two that’s the difficult thing to manage.</p>\\n<h2>“No total rebuilds”</h2>\\n<p>So much has been written on the painful death-march that accompanies ground-up rebuilds of existing products. There will be day-long sprint planning meetings and a grumpy Product Manager yelling at you all the time and…</p>\\n<p>Yup, not fun. Total rebuilds of big legacy products are a massive pain. But there’s one time that they’re justified.</p>\\n<h2>Skyscrapers built on sandcastles</h2>\\n<p>In an early-stage startup, one of the surest ways to acquire a big, ganky, legacy codebase is to build a skyscraper on top of your sandcastle.</p>\\n<p>After two weeks of heads-down hacking, you post <em><a href=\\\"http://InstaYoDogBook.io\\\">InstaYoDogBook.io</a></em> on <a href=\\\"http://www.producthunt.co/\\\">Product Hunt</a>.

Let’s keep #hustling, right?</p>\\n<p>Maybe you take a week or two off from the codebase to #GetOutOfTheBuilding and #TalkToUsers and #DoMoreLeanStuff. This goes well. Back to the code. There are bugs to squash and #JobsToBeDone to, er, be done.</p>\\n<p>Fire up Vim. Shit. You realise that your first 10 000 users are all logging in through a 30 line <code>if</code> statement. That’s never going to hold up! What idiot wrote it? <code>git blame</code>. You did, apparently, but you have no recollection of it. Commit time? 4am. Commit blood-Red Bull level? Lots, probably. You look around, and the whole app is built like this. Who built that thing there? You did, too. Actually, you were being super lean and hacky and built the whole thing, it’s all your fault.</p>\\n<p>This is your sandcastle. What you’ve done is built a very, very brittle product, very quickly. Your sandcastle was absolutely perfect for what you wanted when you were just trying to get something built before the tide came in, but it’s ill-equipped for your needs as you grow the product. How does any of this work? Why on <em>earth</em> did you call that variable <code>foo</code> and forget to rename it? This isn’t fun! Where do you go from here?</p>\\n<p>Write some friggin’ tests, dummy! (Unless you’re DHH, in which case move swiftly along). You try—you try so hard—to pull the app back into a state which is manageable to build on. Add <code>rspec</code> and a bunch of trendy testing bits to your <code>Gemfile</code>. Every new class should have a Single Responsibility and follow the Law of Demeter and have descriptive method names and…you get the point. You turn over a new digital leaf and promise to do everything right in future.</p>\\n<p>But things won’t change, I promise. Good code can’t be written on top of bad code, skyscrapers can’t be be built upon sandcastles. Validation is the most important thing when you’re building a product, but once you’ve got that you have to be ruthless and optimise for developer productivity. No one wants to work on a 2-month-old insta-legacy app.</p>\\n<p>The good thing about being a few weeks or months into a product versus a 5 year old behemoth, though, is that you can quickly &amp; cheaply throw away everything you’ve done and do it again, properly, when the time is right.</p>\\n<p>Don’t build skyscrapers when sandcastles will suffice, but when you move onto a skyscraper down the road, make sure you kick over that sandcastle and start again.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 448 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Selfies\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"date\":\"2014-09-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\"published\":true,\"body\":\"<p>He opens Twitter and taps away at his keyboard.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“It would be really great if amazing designers and developers would work on meaningful things instead of yet more selfie apps”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>His finger lingers over the <em>send</em> button.

That’s understandable — the website has a screenshot of a Mac app, a download button, and a caption saying ‘available for Mac’. Here’s the thing — you can use Framer and join this wonderful community &amp; way of working on <em>any platform</em>. Let me explain…</p>\\n<p>The app you see in the screenshots on the <a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/\\\">Framer website</a> is ‘Framer Studio’. It’s a paid app, for OSX only. The thing that powers it though—Framer.js—is open source, and available for free on GitHub.</p>\\n<p>To save you having to compile the source, Framer provide a simple <a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/static/downloads/Framer.zip\\\">.zip file</a> to get you started - including all of the JavaScript you need, and an HTML file to open in your browser. It’s that simple to get started with Framer on Windows or Linux!</p>\\n<h2>So what’s Framer Studio? Where’s that lovely UI?</h2>\\n<p>Framer Studio is a collection of tools around Framer.js itself. Some of these are unique, some of them you can replicate yourself on <em>any computer</em>. It won’t be as smooth as using Framer Studio on a Mac, but certainly easier than making a trip to the Apple Store.</p>\\n<p>Some of the notable features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>CoffeeScript compilation</li>\\n<li>LiveReload</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>More on those in a second. Some features that you can get an approximation of in  any editor (e.g. <a href=\\\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\\\">Sublime Text</a>):</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Syntax highlighting</li>\\n<li>Snippets</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/awt2542/SublimeCompletionFramerjs\\\">Autocomplete</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And then some more nifty things that are unique to the Mac app:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Templates</li>\\n<li>Sharing</li>\\n<li>Presentation view</li>\\n<li>Mirror</li>\\n<li>Zoom</li>\\n<li>Sketch/Photoshop importing</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Framer Studio is definitely <strong>optional</strong>, but the features you get are <strong>really nice</strong>.</p>\\n<p>With that said: CoffeeScript!</p>\\n<h2>Why does my code break when I try to run the examples from the website?</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/static/downloads/Framer.zip\\\">That link</a> you just download is in <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Framer Studio, and all of the examples on the website, are in <strong>CoffeeScript</strong>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://coffeescript.org/\\\">CoffeeScript</a> is a version of JavaScript with a bunch of nifty features, but most importantly for us, it gets rid of a bunch of brackets. JavaScript <strong>needs_</strong> those brackets.</p>\\n<p>For example, the first page of <a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/learn/basics/\\\">Framer Basics</a> shows you how to create a simple layer.</p>\\n<pre><code>layerA = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Layer\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  x:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">y:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">width:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">height:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If you try to add that to the <code>app.js</code> file you downloaded, you’ll be confronted with some nasty errors. In JavaScript it should look more like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>var layerA = new Layer({\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  x:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>,\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  y:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>,\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  width:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>,\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  height:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Not too different, but enough to make your web browser complain! Let’s look at a more complex example and then I’ll show you how to fix it :)</p>\\n<pre><code>layerA<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span> \\n  properties:\\n    x:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">200</span>\\n  curve: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n\\nlayerA<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.on</span> Events<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.AnimationEnd</span>, -&gt;\\n  layerA<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span>\\n    properties:\\n      x:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n    curve: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In JavaScript that would be more like</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">layerA</span><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span>({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">properties</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">x</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">200</span>\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">curve</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n});\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">layerA</span><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.on</span>(Events.AnimationEnd, function() {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">layerA</span><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span>({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">properties</span>: {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">x</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n    },\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">curve</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n  });\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>At this point, there’s a few things you could do.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You could translate every line of CoffeeScript you read on the Framer website &amp; in other peoples’ code into JavaScript in your head.</li>\\n<li>You could use a website like <a href=\\\"http://js2.coffee/\\\">JS2Coffee</a> and get it to translate itself, then copy &amp; paste that into your project.</li>\\n<li>Or, you can just set up CoffeeScript on your PC.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I really recommend the third option. If you’re a relative newcomer to JavaScript, you don’t need the added hassle of hoping your code matches up to the code you’re reading in a tutorial. It’s much nicer to use the same language as the rest of the community.</p>\\n<p>Luckily, it’s pretty easy to get it all wired up.</p>\\n<h2>The easy way</h2>\\n<p>Whilst there’s nothing like Framer Studio for Windows or Linux, there are some other nice apps that can help us out.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://prepros.io/\\\">Prepros</a> is available for Windows, Linux &amp; Mac, and helps you compile CoffeeScript (as well as Sass, LESS, Jade &amp; others — you can use this for lots of projects besides Framer). To get started, install &amp; open the app, then add the <code>Project</code> folder from the .zip you downloaded earlier.</p>\\n<p>Next, rename <code>app.js</code> to <code>app.coffee</code>, and replace its contents with some CoffeeScript. Here’s what it converts to:</p>\\n<pre><code>iconLayer = new Layer width:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">256</span>, height:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">256</span>, image:<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"images/icon.png\\\"</span>\\niconLayer.center()\\n\\n# Define a <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">set</span> of <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">states with names (the original state is</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">'default'</span><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">)</span>\\niconLayer.states.add\\n  second: {y:100, scale:0.6, rotationZ:100}\\n  third:  {y:300, scale:1.3, blur:4}\\n  fourth: {y:200, scale:0.9, blur:2, rotationZ:200}\\n\\n# <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">Set</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">the default animation options</span>\\niconLayer.states.animationOptions <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">=</span>\\n  curve: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"spring(500,12,0)\\\"</span>\\n\\n# On <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">a click, go to the next state</span>\\niconLayer.on <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">Events.Click, -&gt;</span>\\n  iconLayer.states.next()\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then…</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Drag your folder into Prepros.</li>\\n<li>Click on <code>app.coffee</code></li>\\n<li>Make sure ‘auto compile’ is checked</li>\\n<li>Click ‘process file’</li>\\n<li>Click ‘Live preview’ in the toolbar</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Your browser should open, and your prototype should be running. From there, change anything you want to in <code>app.coffee</code> and your browser should magically reload.</p>\\n<p>There are some other options for compiling Coffeescript on Windows - feel free to use another GUI if that’s what you do already, but Prepress is pretty great for an open source tool.</p>\\n<p>You could also go for more fine-grained control by compiling your Coffeescript etc yourself with something like <code>gulp</code> or <code>grunt</code>, but remember, the goal is to be prototyping as quickly as possible, not getting bogged down in tool configuration :)</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 451 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"layout\":\"post\",\"published\":true,\"date\":\"2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"title\":\"Functional Programming, CSS, and your sanity\",\"body\":\"<p>Learning Clojure and/or Haskell will make you a better programmer. Even if you don’t use it day to day, there are a ton of prescient lessons to be taken back to your language of choice.</p>\\n<p>Functional programming is infectious. I find it beautiful &amp; elegant in much the same way as a <a href=\\\"http://dieterrams.tumblr.com/\\\">Braun watch</a> or Karl Gerstner’s grid system for <a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/watz/2382027037/sizes/l/\\\">Capital magazine</a>. Good design (my preferred school of good design, at least) is mathsy, rational and pure—and CSS is design—so it follows that there are a bunch of lessons we can bring back from FP land into design.</p>\\n<p>I’ve been meaning to write this post for months but technical blogging takes me ages — excuse the brain dump.</p>\\n<p>These ideas have been swirling around for a few years; shout out to <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/jxnblk\\\">Brent Jackson</a> and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mrmrs_\\\">Adam Morse</a> for shipping something incredible in <a href=\\\"http://www.basscss.com/\\\">Basscss</a> &amp; <a href=\\\"http://tachyons.io/\\\">Tachyons</a> respectively, whilst I’ve been sitting and thinking about it.</p>\\n<h1>f(css) is:</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Functional</strong>. Small, clear, easy to read classes that are easy to apply and do one thing. You might have called them ‘utility classes’ with some snark, but they rock. A random example from Basscss would be the margin &amp; padding classes - <code>mb1</code>, <code>px2</code> (margin-bottom-1, padding-x-2) etc. The super short naming conventions are optional (I just love Brent’s implementation) — I guess you could write a library with less terse class names if you’re a masochist, but FP seems to tend toward short variable names. When you consolidate all of your sizing &amp; spacing into reusable classes you <em>force</em> a beautiful type scale &amp; rhythm on your design. Neat!</li>\\n<li><strong>Composable</strong>. In FP it’s fun to compose a bunch of small functions together to create larger actions. The parallel in f(css) is building up big ol’ chains of tiny classes. Think declarative composition — <code>&lt;a class=&quot;mb2 bg-green white px2 rounded&quot;&gt;</code> rather than OO-derived objects &amp; modifiers — <code>&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn--primary&quot;&gt;</code>. Scared of writing lots of classes? No shit, everyone hates typing. Wrap them up in React components to your heart’s content. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames\\\">classnames</a> is a fun module for dynamically composing groups of classes, so you don’t end up with massive strings all over the shop. <strong>The point isn’t to get away from component-based <em>design</em></strong> (which rocks and should be a cornerstone of your design ethos); rather you should get away from component-based CSS, which is crappy and repetitive.</li>\\n<li><strong>Immutable</strong>. On to the fun stuff. Declare a property once and you should be damn sure it’s never going to get overwritten. Fuck specificity. Apply the class you want — margin-bottom, say — and rest assured that no one else’s CSS is going to override it. The problem here is that CSS isn’t immutable (has anyone made an actually-immutable CSS preprocessor? If not I’m going to write one), but be clever in your implementation and it’s <em>kind of like immutability</em>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Referentially transparent</strong>. This is a fancy way of saying ‘it should be guaranteed to do the thing you want it to do’. The cascade and ems are two of the worst things about CSS. I’m tired of playing guesswork because some framework author decided that using multipliers was a good idea.</li>\\n<li><strong>Side-effect free</strong>. not only should a class do the same thing every time, but it should never, ever change anything other than what you’re targeting.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I’m aware that this is almost the polar opposite of both OOCSS/SMACSS, and everything that some semantic web bore told you off for doing once upon a time, but I think this is the future of CSS. It’s easy to reason about, quick to write, lightning fast for browsers to parse, and gets rid of the clusterfuck that is the ‘C’ in CSS.</p>\\n<p>Tweet me if you massively disagree, I’ve fudged an FP metaphor, you’ve built an immutable CSS processor, or you think CSS class names should be machine-readable (lol).</p>\\n<p>edit: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/4lpine\\\">John Otander</a> is working on a linter for immutable CSS.

If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t     * following are equivalent:\n\t     *\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.1.0\n\t     * @category Function\n\t     * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t     * @see R.curryN\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      var addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\n\t     *\n\t     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\n\t     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t     *      var g = f(3);\n\t     *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t     */\n\t    var curry = _curry1(function curry(fn) {\n\t        return curryN(fn.length, fn);\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns all but the first `n` elements of the given list, string, or\n\t     * transducer/transformer (or object with a `drop` method).\n\t     *\n\t     * Dispatches to the `drop` method of the second argument, if present.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.1.0\n\t     * @category List\n\t     * @sig Number -> [a] -> [a]\n\t     * @sig Number -> String -> String\n\t     * @param {Number} n\n\t     * @param {*} list\n\t     * @return {*}\n\t     * @see R.take, R.transduce\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      R.drop(1, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['bar', 'baz']\n\t     *      R.drop(2, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['baz']\n\t     *      R.drop(3, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.drop(4, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.drop(3, 'ramda');               //=> 'da'\n\t     */\n\t    var drop = _curry2(_dispatchable('drop', _xdrop, function drop(n, xs) {\n\t        return slice(Math.max(0, n), Infinity, xs);\n\t    }));\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns a list containing all but the last `n` elements of the given `list`.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.16.0\n\t     * @category List\n\t     * @sig Number -> [a] -> [a]\n\t     * @sig Number -> String -> String\n\t     * @param {Number} n The number of elements of `xs` to skip.\n\t     * @param {Array} xs The collection to consider.\n\t     * @return {Array}\n\t     * @see R.takeLast\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      R.dropLast(1, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['foo', 'bar']\n\t     *      R.dropLast(2, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['foo']\n\t     *      R.dropLast(3, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.dropLast(4, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.dropLast(3, 'ramda');               //=> 'ra'\n\t     */\n\t    var dropLast = _curry2(_dispatchable('dropLast', _xdropLast, _dropLast));\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns a new list containing all but last the`n` elements of a given list,\n\t     * passing each value from the right to the supplied predicate function,\n\t     * skipping elements while the predicate function returns `true`.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

I’m used to iPads and iPhones only having the bare essentials in the box. Are two huge double sided posters of technical disclaimers in every language imaginable and a driver CD necessary? I don’t know how Apple gets around not having detailed warranty information etc in the box, but it must be possible so why can’t Logitech?</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/junk.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/junk.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<h3>The Website</h3>\\n<p>I haven’t had a CD drive for 3 years so I had to hunt through the Logitech website to find a driver otherwise some of the mouse buttons wouldn’t work. Yes, a driver. In 2011. On a Mac. The Logitch website is a horrific experience all around but the thing I find most puzzling is the URL structure. I’ve often wondered why big (enterprise?) sites have URLs that deviate from what we’d choose.</p>\\n<p>As an example, why not rewrite</p>\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7256/kw//session/L3NpZC93c2lCWHB1aw%3D%3D\\\">http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7256/kw//session/L3NpZC93c2lCWHB1aw%3D%3D</a></em></p>\\n<p>as</p>\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"http://support.logitech.com/products/v470/manuals\\\">http://support.logitech.com/products/v470/manuals</a></em></p>\\n<p>Surely it’s just a matter of appropriate routing?</p>\\n<p>I opened up that question to <a href=\\\"http://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-websites-have-unreadable-URLs\\\">Quora</a>; if you have any suggestions I’d love it if you commented here or answered on Quora.</p>\\n<p>The rest of the website was similarly horrible and unusable, it’s like they stop employing UX designers for existing customer-facing pages.</p>\\n<h3>Software</h3>\\n<p>Now to install the driver. Standard install, until I get asked this question. Bearing in mind I’m ‘installing’ a mouse. Not a keyboard. On a Mac. That has it’s own keyboard layout. I wonder if this option actually affects anything in the system or just serves to confuse users?</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Keyboard-Selection.png\\\"><img src=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Keyboard-Selection.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>With all that done, I now have to restart my Mac (I thought we left that at Windows 98?), and then go to the proprietary control panel. Why deviate from expected UI conventions? Why do I need a separate app to configure the behaviour of a scroll wheel? <em>Why can’t you be more like Apple?</em></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/V470-Bluetooth-Laser-Travel-Mouse.png\\\"><img src=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/V470-Bluetooth-Laser-Travel-Mouse.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>Maybe I’m making a big deal out of nothing, maybe there are technical limitations I’m overlooking. Or maybe I’ve come to expect beautifully thought out products from years of using Apple products. Whatever it is, I’ve spent the entire day angry at poor UX decisions that could easily be rectified.</p>\\n<p>Having products as rough around the edges as this leaves a sour taste in my mouth and makes me think Logitech just doesn’t care about me so long as they have my money.</p>\\n<p>Which is a shame, because it’s a nice mouse.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011/05/when-ux-goes-bad.md\n ** module id = 427\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-08-01 10:09:01\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"living-the-dream-part-one\",\"status\":\"publish\",\"published\":false,\"title\":\"Living the Dream, Part One\",\"wordpress_id\":\"66\",\"categories\":[\"Prismatic\",\"San Francisco\"],\"body\":\"<p>If you’ve been following my tweets recently you’ll have noticed I’ve been waking up and going to sleep rather late. 8 hours late, actually.

But I have a\\nshiny new blog urging me to write on. So here we go, stream of\\nconciousness style.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Before I start, it’s been difficult over the years to restrain public\\nranting about Ravensbourne. What follows is a completely objective\\npost about my experience there, after the dust has had sufficient time\\nto settle; it’s more rational and less emotional than the drafts I’ve\\nwritten over the years.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>The Good.</h3>\\n<p>Learning typography in a traditional setting, from people who have been\\nthere (Basel/Zurich), done that, and kerned the t-shirt. Typesetting <em>by\\nhand, on paper</em>. Learning about grids, 1-on-1, from actual Modernists\\nwho actually knew Muller-Brockmann. <strong>Having Wim fucking Crouwel come in\\nfor an intimate lecture on your birthday</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Spending three years in a studio with classmates— laughing, joking,\\nkerning, stressing out, sticking in, cutting out, learning together\\nand <strong>teaching each other</strong>. Having older students to look up to, and\\nhaving younger students to (hopefully) pass things on to. <strong>Just being\\nin that environment for that amount of time is incredibly valuable.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>You can’t replicate that learning from home</strong> (due to the internet not\\nbeing the greatest setting for learning design), or at an\\ninternship/apprenticeship/etc (due to time constraints), but I’m not\\nsure it’s valuable enough to justify the investment.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/07/n725840617_5477295_151.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>The Bad.</h3>\\n<p><strong>Feeling like The Good Ship Web Design is sailing off without you_.\\n_<strong>Thinking you’ve had enough learning and want to start doing. Right\\nnow.</strong> Before another amazing site gets launched that you didn’t have\\nthe chance to work on.</strong> Because you’re sat in a classroom meeting\\nunproductive assessment criteria when you could be doing meaningful\\nwork. Seeing younger designers (who haven’t committed to years of\\neducation) achieve great things, and curse yourself for being stuck in\\nthis situation.</p>\\n<p>**On Sketchbooks, and ticking boxes: **of course we have to learn to\\ndesign on paper. No one disputes that. Going straight to the Mac is a\\nmistake we’re all guilty of in the early stages of our careers, and we\\ncould all stand to keep better visual scrapbooks. <strong>Sketchbooks are\\nbrilliant.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>But not when they’re a key component of assessment</strong>. I’m dyspraxic\\nand, to cut to the chase, when I’m in <strong>the zone</strong> I can’t slow down,\\nprint out what I’m doing, neatly cut it out and stick it into a\\nsketchbook, then annotate it just to show the assessors my thought\\nprocess. Not without ruining my work and focus.</p>\\n<p>Just one example.</p>\\n<p>Outdated assessment styles and disability discrimination combining to\\nmake for <strong>mediocre outcomes</strong>; just one example of how inappropriate\\nand self-serving design education has become. Nice. **If a degree has to\\nbe compromised to be shoehorned in to the national education framework\\nthen it’s not appropriate anymore. **</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/07/n725840617_5477285_8646.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Education can’t do digital.</h3>\\n<p>The problem is BA (Hons) degrees need to be validated. They need to have\\na set curriculum, with set projects and assessment criteria for those\\nprojects. Web design is moving so fast that just taking an hour out to\\nwrite this post has caused me to fall behind(!). <strong>There’s no way that\\nsomething as fast moving as web design can be shoehorned into a 3-year\\nvalidation cycle.</strong> Ish.</p>\\n<p><strong>Front-end code can’t be taught in universities.</strong> Period. It’s moving\\ntoo fast. C++ and Java can be taught, but they’re not moving at\\nbreakneck pace. <strong>Let’s forget the idea of web design education\\nrequiring a code component.</strong> I just can’t see a way it can be done. <strong>I\\nstill passionately believe that every graduating designer should know\\nhow to write HTML and CSS, but the classroom isn’t the place for it.</strong></p>\\n<p>What the classroom <strong>can</strong> teach is design for the web. User Experience\\ndesign. <strong>How to think like a web designer, rather than a print designer\\ndoing a website</strong>. Big difference. And that’s not being taught properly\\nbecause the staff aren’t in place. With such a high demand for good web\\ndesigners at the moment who would choose to teach? What you get is\\ntutors who honed their skills as print designers being told by\\nmanagement to ‘make things digital’. It doesn’t work.</p>\\n<p>But that’s the only hope I can see for design education - <strong>have\\nrelevant tutors teaching relevant design, or die</strong>.</p>\\n<h3>The Outcome.</h3>\\n<p>Things worked out for me in the end, but I wonder if it was directly a\\nresult of design education as a system, or a combination of chances on\\nthe side. One example is if Ravensbourne hadn’t scrapped its analog\\nfacilities (screenprinting, letterpress, darkroom) I would have been\\ncontent making posters. Without these facilities I became jaded with\\nprint design which led me to web design. <strong>In a roundabout,\\nunintentional way, my education made me a web designer.</strong></p>\\n<p>But that’s just my story - knowing what I know now, I don’t think I\\ncould recommend any design course apart from <a href=\\\"http://www.hyperisland.se/\\\">Hyper\\nIsland</a>. Possibly some of the <a href=\\\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/\\\">UAL\\ncolleges</a> if you’re intent on being a print\\ndesigner at the end of it but** so was I**.</p>\\n<h3>‘But I want to be a print designer!’</h3>\\n<p>In 3 years I’m sure the web will be even a more attractive prospect than\\nit is today, and I think you’d be foolish to not pursue a career in\\ndigital design.** Seriously. It’s awesome.**</p>\\n<h3>What are the other options?</h3>\\n<p>Try to find a job somewhere that will teach you the ropes. Not an agency\\nstill creating Flash or tables. Apprenticeships like <a href=\\\"http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/want-to-be-our-apprentice\\\">Mark\\nBoulton</a>\\nwas offering are a great idea. I don’t have the answers yet, but I do\\nknow that design school shouldn’t be the best one. I really hope some\\nday we can solve this problem, because there <strong>are</strong> positives to formal\\ndesign education. I’m just incredibley jaded by my experiences.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011/08/thinking-about-design-school.md\n ** module id = 430\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-09-15 08:58:12\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"on-windows-8\",\"status\":\"publish\",\"title\":\"On Windows 8\",\"wordpress_id\":\"159\",\"body\":\"<p>This is a post I thought I’d never write. I just installed the <a href=\\\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516\\\">developer preview</a> of Windows 8 and really like it.</p>\\n<p>The thing is, Windows 8 is a very impressive operating system. Shockingly good, if you consider the low standard we expect from Microsoft. <strong>Metro is utterly gorgeous</strong>. I fundamentally disagree with Apple’s descent into skeumorphism. I disagree with the principles behind it and the way I see their interfaces going in the next 5-10 years. On the other hand <strong>Metro is fresh and bold</strong>, but most importantly it looks like something one of my favourite designers would have created. <strong>It’s straight out of 1960s Switzerland</strong>, but rather than falling into the trap of being too flat and too rigid an interpretation of 60s Modernism, the whole thing feels clickable, touchable and interactable. It’s a balance I’ve struggled with for as long as I’ve been designing interfaces, so I can appreciate the solution they’ve presented.</p>\\n<p>It neatly avoids the trap that Apple and Android UIs have fallen into - hinting at depth is fine, but descending into a clusterfuck of of faux-leather textures, glossy buttons and redundant metaphors is taking it too far.</p>\\n<h3>But wasn’t Windows Phone 7 a bit shit?</h3>\\n<p>Yup. I’ve admired Metro for a while, but found it to be too ambitious for a smartphone. It just feels cluttered on a 4&quot; screen. Or maybe it was just badly implemented. <strong>There was a huge disparity from looking at the beautiful screenshots and actually using it.</strong> What does this mean for WP7? That’s not within the scope of this blogpost. On a 10&quot; tablet though, with more room to let the design breathe? <strong>This could be a serious competitor for the ‘lounging on the sofa checking Twitter’ category.</strong></p>\\n<h3>What about Aero?</h3>\\n<p>I can appreciate a juggernaut like Microsoft being afraid of alienating users with a rapid change of direction. I don’t like it, but I can appreciate their business goals. I think there will have to be some future iteration of Windows with Aero in it. <strong>But I don’t see the dual-interface thing working out well for them - it presents too many compromises in hardware performance and interface usability</strong>. It shows that Microsoft didn’t learn from a decade of unsellable ‘tablet’ devices. With that said, Aero does look a little nicer than on Windows 7. Perhaps they should release an updated Aero as Windows 7.5.</p>\\n<h3>Bi-interfacing ≠ #winning.</h3>\\n<p>Switching between two interfaces just isn’t going to work. Not for a tablet OS. Click targets and tap targets are too different.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/metro\\\">Gruber made an interesting point the other day</a> - perhaps on desktop you’ll have both Metro and Aero; on tablet devices just Metro. That would be fantastic. I wouldn’t use a desktop version of Windows any time soon, but in the event that they really nailed the tablet ecosystem I could see myself trading my iPad for a Windows tablet for casual use.</p>\\n<p>If they get rid of Aero on tablets they’ll have a shot at producing cheap, light tablets with modest hardware and excellent battery life.</p>\\n<h3>So you think Microsoft is going to whoop Apple’s ass?</h3>\\n<p>Nope. My spidey-sense is telling me <strong>Microsoft is organisationally incapable of doing anything exceptional</strong>. They’ve hired some fantastic designers but I just don’t see them working as a team to create a great product. The design teams are only a tiny blip in MSFT’s organisational structure, and there are too many potential conflicts of interest that will prevent them from creating a beautiful and pure OS. <strong>Godforbid they make a Metro-style Ribbon…</strong></p>\\n<p>The other reason is fragmentation. Without a full-stack offering to compete with Apple (or soon, Google-Motorola) it will still be Windowsy. <strong>Things will still break</strong>. Asian OEMs will still release shitty hardware, and that shitty hardware will work like shit with Windows 8.</p>\\n<p>Let’s not forget why we made (and enjoyed) the switch to Macs -** it wasn’t that OS9/X was prettier than Windows** (arguably the first few iterations of OSX were ugly as sin compared to the more restrained XP) - <strong>it was that Macs just worked</strong>, and we were sick of .dll files, registry entries and things breaking on PCs.</p>\\n<p><strong>And that’s the most important thing Apple still has going for it, because they can’t rely on their interfaces any more.</strong></p>\\n<p>—</p>\\n<p>If you have Windows 8 installed I’d love to know your thoughts in the comments!</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011/09/on-windows-8.md\n ** module id = 431\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-10-26 18:13:56\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"burgers-tablets-typography\",\"status\":\"publish\",\"title\":\"Burgers, Tablets & Typography\",\"published\":true,\"body\":\"<p>If there’s one thing I love more than talking about technology and looking at typefaces, it’s burgers. My stomach was pleasantly surprised to discover In-N-Out Burger whilst living in San Francisco this summer but something else struck me about visiting the restaurant.</p>\\n<p>They’re a great case study in contrast. Contrast is <em>the</em> differentiating factor in turning otherwise good work to great - from typography and grid systems to whole product lines.

No vegetarian burger, no chicken burger, no fish burger. No Texas BBQ burger, no Angus Bacon Double Whopper Extreme burger.</p>\\n<p>Just a burger, a burger with cheese, and a burger with cheese and more meat. Easy to pick, easy for the franchise to make, easy product line to maintain. Better by less.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/innoutmenu.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Let’s compare that to <a href=\\\"http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/full_menu_explorer.html\\\">McDonalds’ menu</a>. I count 57 burgers, main salads and wraps; that’s before we get to sides and desserts.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/full_menu_explorer.html\\\"><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/mcdonaldsmenu.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>Perhaps three burgers is <em>too spartan</em> a menu. That’s fine - I’m partial to some chili and guacamole on my burgers from time to time, and vegetarian friends felt alienated when the rest of the group suggested eating at In-N-Out. But that doesn’t mean that we should go back to the McDonalds option of having several dozen shitty products instead of three great ones though. Five options? Six? Seven? Some kind of reasonable compromise before descending into fast food choice paralysis hell.</p>\\n<p>Of course I’m not suggesting that we make a habit of eating fast food (or offering business advice to McDonalds), so let’s look further afield. Where else do we have no product differentiation and ridiculous naming strategies? Technology, of course!</p>\\n<h3>The elephant in the phone store</h3>\\n<p>If I was going to buy an Android phone I’d have a hard time making up my mind. “A Galaxy? A Nexus? A Nexus S? A Galaxy Nexus Droid Extreme SII Ace? Wait, a Galaxy Nexus is a thing? I thought they were separate products? Gah, sod it, I’ll buy an iPhone”</p>\\n<p>This choice isn’t empowering the consumer; it’s not being kind and giving them options. It’s two things - overpowering them with choice to scare them into buying something, and releasing a string of mediocre, expendable and replaceable products. Not cool.</p>\\n<p>Apple sell the new iPhone, the slightly older iPhone, and the old-but-still-better-than-any-Android iPhone. The three hamburgers.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare-iphones/\\\"><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/Apple-iPhone-Compare.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<h3>Size matters</h3>\\n<p>Why won’t Apple release a 4&quot; iPhone and a 7&quot; iPad? The In-N-Out Principle at work again. A 7&quot; iPad would dilute the value of the 9.7&quot; iPad. Different sizes suggest different use cases - a 7&quot; iPad wouldn’t be different enough to the 9.7&quot; iPad to warrant different applications, context and mindset. It would just be a slightly squised 9.7&quot; iPad.</p>\\n<p>Samsung have released or announced 5.4&quot;, 7&quot;, 7.7&quot;, 8.9&quot; &amp; 10.1&quot; tablets (with multiple models of some); in addition to a range of phones which goes up to the 4.65&quot; Galaxy Nexus. With such small gaps between products, Samsung has ruled out the possibility of unique and innovative uses.

Let’s go back to graphic design. I’ve been meaning to write an article about the principles behind good grid systems for a while now.</p>\\n<p>In the same way as fewer burgers to choose from helps us make a decision and fill our stomach with meaty goodness, fewer possible combinations of grid units make each one stronger.</p>\\n<p>The simplified layouts below take the same basic shape  - using a more rigid grid with less flexibility makes for a more tense layout; increasing options makes the whole thing more sloppy.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-01.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-02.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>And an example with more representative content - again the beauty of a grid (unity, contrast and tension) is lost with an increasing number of decreasingly significant options for content placement.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-04.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/gridgrey-03.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Again, I’m not suggesting that we should always stick to 4 column grids, but when you start your next project make sure you consider the implications and relevance of the grid you’re working with. Less is often more.</p>\\n<h3>Surely you can’t make typography about burgers too?</h3>\\n<p>You bet! This is the big one. I’ve been <a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/2011/10/calendar/\\\">offering little tidbits of design advice</a> to early-stage startups and aspiring designers recently, and one thing that keeps coming up is refining typography. Not a huge overhaul, not the Swiss ‘kerning tiny bits of paper by hand’ exercises we were forced to do in design school (more on that another time) - just little tweaks and principles that make a world of difference. How? Limiting options, of course!</p>\\n<p>Creating and sticking to a strict type scale is a great first step. Limit the options of typefaces and weights. One typeface in one weight in one size can be effective; two weights, typefaces and sizes is fine. But using 5 typefaces on a site, in an inconsistent range of sizes and every weight they come in? You’re back to McDonalds again.</p>\\n<p>In Josef Müller-Brockmann’s seminal book ‘<a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grid-Systems-Graphic-Design-Typographers/dp/3721201450/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319646813&amp;sr=8-5\\\">Grid Systems in Graphic Design</a>’ there’s a brilliant illustration of this concept - if you don’t own the book then I highly recommend it.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/Grid-Systems-1.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Of course this principle isn’t just applicable to graphic design, tablet computers and beefburgers - in almost any field or application, limiting choice makes each option stronger by itself and stronger as the sum of parts.</p>\\n<p>And next time you’re in California, stop by In-N-Out.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011/10/burgers-tablets-typography.md\n ** module id = 432\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-10-03 12:31:19\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"slug\":\"calendar\",\"published\":false,\"title\":\"Opening up my calendar\",\"wordpress_id\":\"167\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve freed up ~an hour/day in my calendar to help advise early-stage startups and young designers — <a href=\\\"http://officehours.tv/\\\">Office Hours</a> style.

Another\\n<em>thing</em>.</p>\\n<p>But I’m pretty sure there’s not <em>a thing</em> in my physical living room\\ncalled a ‘Find My Friends’. The metaphor is empty. It’s not referring to\\nanything. It’s just a leather texture.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/IMG_0054.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Paper doesn’t scroll; much less so a digital map debossed into a\\nbevelled <a href=\\\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/12/find-my-friends\\\">Corinthian\\nleather</a>\\nsurround.

Google Latitude was way too professional looking. —@jazzpazz</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>So what do we do with no metaphor to go for?</h3>\\n<p>A logical conclusion might be that skeuomorphism is so ingrained in Apple’s visual language now that moving past it is impossible. That every new Apple app should be doused in texture. That the brand-new iTunes Movie Trailers app should be draped in red velvet curtains, with crushed popcorn scattered around.</p>\\n<p>That would be nice and familiar for users, wouldn’t it?</p>\\n<p>Of course not.</p>\\n<p>Apple can and did build a better application in this case by avoiding the obvious metaphors and just <em>making a good app</em>.</p>\\n<p>It can be done.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/itunes_movie_trailers_ipad.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Neat! What other metaphors are broken?</h3>\\n<p>Newspapers and magazines. The first wave of iPad newspaper apps was a skeuomorphic shitstorm. Accidentally picking up the print edition of The Metro ruins my morning commute, but <a href=\\\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/metro-tablet-edition/id463429891?mt=8\\\">the iPad version</a> is infinitely worse. I get it. You like your columns and smudged ink. You don’t want to put any design thought into this newfangled iPad business. Laziness won’t win you any friends.</p>\\n<p>In contrast, the newly released Guardian app is brilliantly un-skeuomorphic. There are no <a href=\\\"http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/wired-on-ipad-just-like-a-paper-tiger/\\\">for-the-sake-of-it columns</a>, no <a href=\\\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-early-edition/id363496943?mt=8\\\">blackletter mastheads</a>, just a clean grid and perfect typography. I think it’s a huge improvement over the vast majority of iOS news-delivery apps. As a vehicle for branded periodical content (as opposed to an aggregator such as Reeder) it might be the most forward-thinking app <em>period.</em></p>\\n<p>The Guardian <em>get it.</em></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/IMG_0050.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>And then Apple fuck it all up.</h3>\\n<p>Newsstand is a problem. Having a single collection for all branded periodical content is awesome and useful. Having a single location for purchasing those apps is also awesome. Forcing that content into <em>another</em> outdated metaphor—in this case a wooden shelf of printed media—is wrong. Especially when lots of the content (e.g. the Guardian) is pushing past that metaphor to create new, unique, and appropriate experiences.</p>\\n<p>The Guardian app breaks past the page/paper/column metaphor. Newsstand tries to neatly shovel it back into the days of print. For familiarity. <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk\\\">Familiarity that won’t be present in the very near future</a>. It completely ignores the design direction the Guardian team have taken.</p>\\n<p><strong>It takes the easy way out, and as designers we don’t believe in easy.</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2011/10/IMG_0053.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Yesterday’s News</h3>\\n<p>The transition from daily print newspapers to daily iPad news(~papers) has been uninspired. In the age of Twitter it seems ridiculous to wait for your news - breaking news is now instant; confirmed reporting and reaction comes within minutes and hours. By the time print newspapers report on the story it seems quaint and backwards. Old news.</p>\\n<p>Over the past few days there’s been great discussion on Twitter about the place of the Guardian app - whether it is a step backwards or forwards, and whether we need daily editions of yesterday’s news at all. Miles Cheverton hits some great points in <a href=\\\"http://thetalldesigner.com/blog/2011/10/15/the-last-spasms-of-a-dying-business-model-why-the-guardian-ipad-app-is-a-step-into-the-past/\\\">The Last Spasms of a Dying Business Model</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>[The Guardian] is trying to fit an old media paradigm (the daily print) into a world where days don’t really exist, into a world where we can update things as they happen, in a world where you can write an article about a terrorist attack as soon as it happens in 6 words, extend it to 6 paragraphs an hour later and extend that to a 6 section in depth analysis. None of the possibilities and advantages of working with a fast, constantly connected smart media device are used, even when doing so would be cheaper.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>And I absolutely agree with this. I agreed with it so much that I wrote 10 000 words arguing the same thing for my dissertation a year ago. But then the Saturday edition of the paper landed (automatically) in my Newsstand this morning. And then I changed my mind about this particular metaphor. Kind of.</p>\\n<h3>Branded content is nice.</h3>\\n<p>It’s nice reading content by the Guardian. They’re a brand I trust, whether in print, on the web or online.</p>\\n<h3>A curated collection of content is nice.</h3>\\n<p>I appreciate the Guardian’s curation of content - being able to flick through relevant things that I might otherwise miss on my strict diet of only reading articles linked to by John Gruber. Whilst they have _every_thing on their website, it’s nice to just be shown <em>some</em> things. Just the things that matter today.</p>\\n<h3>It doesn’t have to compete with instant.</h3>\\n<p>In the same way that the weekend newspapers are a more leisurely, editorial discussion rather than break-neck to-the-minute reporting, I see a future in ‘trusted news sources’ providing that editorial discussion. Realtime is great, but if you’re adamant that a daily edition is good then make it interesting stuff we haven’t read rather than what we read as it happened yesterday.</p>\\n<h3>Cognitive dissonance, Jon?</h3>\\n<p>Not really. Two different metaphors. The visual metaphor and the daily edition metaphor. The issue I care most about is ridding the world of me-too skeumorphic monstrosities. I care that future apps for finding my friends don’t look like a thrifted leather jacket, and I care that future digital content delivery mechanisms don’t look like print newspapers.</p>\\n<p>The Guardian app doesn’t look like print, it looks like the future. The content could do with <strong>either</strong> being realtime <strong>or</strong> focussing more on editorials, but for now the fact that it specifically doesn’t look like its print edition is enough for me.</p>\\n<p><strong>The priority for us as visual designers should be to out-innovate skeuomorphism - not just for ourselves, but for the next generation.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>The ones who will never pick up a printed newspaper or magazine.</strong></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011/10/the-metaphors-breaking-the-future.md\n ** module id = 434\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"date\":\"2011-11-26 17:42:51\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"published\":true,\"title\":\"I bought a Lumia (the £500 blog post)\",\"body\":\"<p>It’s no secret that I’ve been growing frustrated with Apple recently. Their trend of <a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/2011/10/the-metaphors-breaking-the-future/\\\">skeuomorphism</a> is alienating me as a designer and making me question the future of their products. I’ve been interested in the direction <a href=\\\"http://designedbygold.com/2011/09/on-windows-8/\\\">Microsoft</a> are taking for a while, though until now there haven’t really been any killer devices to take advantage of it yet. So I’ve stuck with my iPhone. I think this is all going to change with the brand new Nokia Lumia 800 - a high end, beautifully designed phone that really does the Windows Phone 7 operating system justice.</p>\\n<p>Actually, I was so curious about the Lumia that I spent £470 of my own money on one to put it through its paces. I should probably just ask for a review copy in future. But hey, I have a great phone and I want to tell you all about it!</p>\\n<p>I’m not great at writing tech reviews, and over the past few drafts this post has taken all different formats. Perhaps the best way is to just note down some thoughts and then open up for questions and discussion in the comments? I’m happy to answer anything, try out apps, take screenshots or check your websites are rendering properly.</p>\\n<p>So in no particular order, my thoughts on the Lumia 800.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6361236563_f470101502.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"P1060881.jpg\\\"></p>\\n<p>The hardware is a stroke of genius - after every generation of the iPhone it’s surely the nicest phone on the market. It’s actually comfier to hold that an iPhone without the bargain-bin tackiness of Android devices. Really sensational, and I’ve been getting a lot of comments about it. One of the only bad bits about the hardware is the screen - it’s an AMOLED PenTile and every bit as bad as the Androids with similar panels. It warps colours and distorts images, and really puts me off developing for the device.</p>\\n<p>The other thing is battery. The majority of my second day with the Lumia was spent without it - I forgot to charge it overnight and apparently my MacBook Pro doesn’t provide enough juice to charge it. Neither does a 240V iPad wall charger. So I had to wait until I got home to use the Nokia charger. Sidenote - but in the intervening hours (not realising what was wrong with it) I’d tried hard resetting the phone to get it to boot up. So I lost all my data because of the shitty power management. Oops!</p>\\n<p>Describing what’s great about this device keeps coming back to <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)\\\">Metro</a> though. Metro - Microsoft’s new visual language - is absolutely breathtaking. Metro makes <em>almost all</em> apps look fantastic, not just those by A-list developers. The UI elements are gorgeous, the animations are gorgeous and the icons are gorgeous. The phone, as I’ve mentioned before and as <em>everyone who sees it</em> remarks is also gorgeous.</p>\\n<p>The Twitter app is beautiful. The Spotify app is beautiful. All of the apps are beautiful. Perhaps I’m overly keen to like Metro, but it seems like a solid framework for good apps. With the trend towards skeuomorphism I’m more worried about the legacy of apps designed outside the still-talented towers of Cupertino. With UI guidelines as strong as Metro I’d hope everyone will be producing aesthetically beautiful apps. Time will tell.</p>\\n<p>The scroll physics are generally great - not as perfect as iOS, but infinitely better than the jarring, jerky, strobe physics of Android. This is a huge coup for Nokia - if only because it kills dead Android’s argument that fragmentation means you can’t optimise for smooth scrolling. Nokia have done, and it makes the device a pleasure to use.</p>\\n<p>What lets it down is ecosystem. Not the Zune/Xbox Live ecosystem—I’ve only ever had bad experiences buying media through the iTunes Store—rather just the <em>feeling</em> of using the device. <a href=\\\"http://thenextweb.com/author/matthewpanzarino/\\\">Matthew Panzarino</a> points to the lack of quality apps in his review, which is definitely something I noticed. Everything you’d expect (Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, 1Password, WordPress etc) is there, but there are none of the gems that make iOS a delight to use. TweetBot, Reeder, Instapaper, OmniFocus are sorely missed, and I could never consider giving up my iPhone without decent replacements for them. Pretty typography in apps seemingly doesn’t make them good. D’oh!</p>\\n<p>Bing Maps is awful and unreadable. It’s a shame, especially considering how much richer Android is as a platform for its superior maps. But that’s not a WP7 problem - it’s a Microsoft problem.</p>\\n<p>There’s no way to take screenshots on this device. <em>There’s no way to take screenshots on this device</em>. Seriously? There’s <a href=\\\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=14076592\\\">this hack</a>, but it seems like a bit of a cludge. Come on guys, I have a blog full of people I want to show the beautiful interface to!</p>\\n<p>Having all of your social media accounts baked into the phone is a nice touch - the system level integration with Facebook that lets me see my girlfriend’s photos on the same card as her phone number and email address is great.</p>\\n<p>The Lumia seems to support the latest and greatest in web standards - one painful example for designers is the lack of Helvetica on the device, so either embed it with @font-face or get used to seeing lots of Arial! Media queries have been fine in my testing - as with web fonts, if you want me to test anything please let me know in the comments.</p>\\n<p>When asked how I like the device I keep catching myself prefixing the review with ‘actually, surprisingly, it’s really nice!’. Not ‘it’s really nice’. But a patronising semi-excuse. And this is the problem with Microsoft and Nokia. They might have produced a fantastic product but at least on this occasion it will not be viewed on a level playing field. Remember rooting for the underdog North Korean football (<em>soccer</em>) team during the 2010 World Cup? That’s this.</p>\\n<p>The flip side is I have to keep questioning myself and what I believe in. Cellphones should not prompt an existential crisis. It’s just a phone. But I keep having to ask myself whether I want Apple to win, or I want <em>better</em> to win. As a designer I hope I always go for better. Metro is undeniably gorgeous but I still can’t form an objective opinion about whether the phone as a whole is good enough to replace my iPhone.</p>\\n<p>The facts say it’s good enough. My heart says no.</p>\\n<p>I just can’t rationalise living outside of the Apple safety net. 80% of the population probably can, and will love a phone that <em>smokes</em> Android.</p>\\n<p><em>I’m going to be auctioning off the Lumia when I’ve finished having a play with it, with any profits going to Movember.

I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to spend a fast-paced weekend learning about it from amazing mentors!</p>\\n<p><strong>What is Lean Startup Machine?</strong> Different to the type of hackathon you might be used to, Lean Startup Machine focuses on <strong>validated learning</strong> as an outcome rather than coded &amp; designed prototypes.

You might be familiar with the <a href=\\\"http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas\\\">Business Model Canvas</a> (a visual grid for describing and iterating on business models); the Validation Board is a similar idea for earlier stage exploration. It’s a really neat way to note down your Hypotheses and  Assumptions at each step of the process, and keep track of the work you’ve done. I found using the Validation Board invaluable in two areas - it helped crystallise our team’s thinking, and it allowed wandering mentors and friends to understand our progress quickly and easily. 5-7 words per post-it note, all uppercase, no rambling. Boom!</p>\\n<p>You can <a href=\\\"http://leanstartupmachine.com/validationboard/\\\">download a Validation Board for free online</a> as a PDF and Keynote template, but consider taking it to a print shop and getting an A1 print to stick on your wall. Also take some time to watch the videos on the site - they go some way to explaining how it should be used.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.root%7D%7D/public/images/p/2012/10/ValidationBoard.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Our ValidationBoard\\\"></p>\\n<p>Before this weekend I wondered what people <strong>actually do</strong> at a Lean Startup Machine course - I knew there was no hacking or designing involved, but I couldn’t picture ‘talking to customers’. Would we be roleplaying? Would a mentor stand on stage and just tell us theoretical teachings? Hell no! <strong>The weekend revolved around getting out of the building</strong> (physically and metaphorically). ‘Get Out Of The Building’ is a synonym for ‘Getting Out of Your Head’ - it turned out phoning contacts and conducting online qualitative &amp; quantitative research was ‘out of the building’ too.</p>\\n<p>But I digress - <strong>actually getting out of the building and talking to real strangers was hugely valuable to me.</strong> I definitely have a tendency to bottle up ideas and wait until they’re ‘perfect’ to unleash them on the world - no more!.</p>\\n<p>Our initial idea was a ‘platform for sci-fi fans to get involved with the production of movies’. <strong>Kickstarter meets GitHub. In space.</strong> A way for fans to cut through blockbuster disappointment and get the movies <strong>they wanted</strong> produced. This worked out quite well for the exercise - sci-fi fans are a very targeted demographic and this allowed us to pin them down to some quite specific geographic locations. So first thing on Saturday morning we went to the ‘scene of the customer’ —Forbidden Planet in Soho—and talked to some customers!</p>\\n<p>We learnt a few things that morning:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Speaking to strangers isn’t so scary once you get into it.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://dex.io/robfitz/how-to-screw-up-custdev/\\\">Asking non-leading questions</a> is really difficult.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The people we talked to hated our idea.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Know when’s the time to pitch your ideas to people - you learn a lot more by <em>listening</em> rather than <em>talking</em>.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>From this initial invalidation we picked up on some great insights from our customers - they were mainly happy with the selection of media available, but lots had friends producing low-budget horror—not sci-fi—films. Ketchup and a MiniDV camera, that sort of thing. These friends supposedly had a tough time getting their films heard about online, which we thought was a shame, so <strong>we decided to pull our first pivot and talk to some filmmakers.</strong> Surely they’d love our new idea of a social media marketing &amp; analytics tool?</p>\\n<p>One of the things every team was worried about this was <strong>‘where do we find customers to talk to at the weekend?’</strong>. In the real world we have days and weeks to track down people to talk to, but we had to move ultra-fast and iterate several times over a weekend. Answer? You’ll figure it out, trust me.</p>\\n<p>Scouring Facebook, Twitter &amp; LinkedIn, wracking our brains and breaking into a film school (seriously) we found ~20 filmmakers eager to talk to us about their craft. We were convinced they’d love our social media idea (though again we weren’t pitching it to them - rather seeing if they’d validate our assumptions). Again a resounding rejection - a vast majority of them pointed out that they had to keep their work <strong>offline</strong> so it was eligible for film festivals - the major events that they were worried about. <strong>Pivot again</strong>, this wasn’t working.</p>\\n<p>Talking to more filmmakers we found out that whilst film festivals are important, after the festivals lots of films fail to find their way to an audience. Our final idea - <strong>a service to let fans watch independent films that otherwise wouldn’t be made available.</strong> A two-sided market, we also envisaged it as a <strong>platform for filmmakers to gain leverage and social proof to showcase their work to independent cinemas</strong> in the hopes of bringing them back to the silver screen. The filmmakers and film festival organisers we spoke to were unanimously keen on this idea (some even rushing to send us trailers and information to use) - which we took as validation. Running out of time in the weekend, we also decided to put up a landing page to gauge whether fans would sign up.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://underdogfilms.co\\\">It’s not the prettiest site</a> I’ve hacked\\ntogether but for an hour’s work (and treating it just as part of the\\nprocess &amp; learning experience) we felt it did a great job - £75 of\\nAdWords, a couple of tweets and several hundred visitors later it’s\\nstill maintaining a <strong>17% conversion rate</strong>. Better than the 3% conversion rate we’d hoped for!</p>\\n<p>Overall a fantastic weekend - I met some fantastic people (participants,\\nmentors and the customers we spoke to!) and <strong>learnt more in 48 hours</strong> than I thought possible. There’s definitely more we could have done at every stage, but I’m glad we didn’t obsess on detail and instead moved quickly through the process - there’s time to conduct really thorough experiments in the real world!</p>\\n<p>Top things I learnt this weekend</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Don’t hold onto ideas too tightly</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>(In)validate your assumptions</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Talk to real people, not your friends &amp; parents!</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I had a fantastic time and would recommend it to anyone (the crowd was surprisingly diverse - not the usual homogeneity of designers &amp; developers).

Would love to have you in the group talking about the day — send a request to join :)</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/jason-the-nimble-process\\\">Jason Santa Maria</a> talked about process. We’re well past the stage where we should be going off into a Design Cave™ and come out the other end with a pixel-perfect ‘painting of a website’; we need to adapt our workflow to iterations. We need to learn how to ship great work consistently; there’s a tension between being a perfectionist and having consistent iteration cycles. I always thought it was weird how the engineers in our startups work to an Agile process but we sometimes add on a ‘waterfall’ layer of design before that.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/tyler-appropriate-tension\\\">Tyler Mincey</a> spoke about his time at Apple working with some amazing inter-disciplinary teams and how we get the best work done working with others. Great insight into the dynamics of the best teams.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/michael-the-inertia-of-ideas\\\">Michael Heilemann</a> did a quick talk on doing work you want to be doing. The stuff you do in your spare time is the stuff you should be doing 9-5.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/tiago-responsive-teaching\\\">Tiago Pedras</a> made me want to be a teacher. Since I graduated I’ve had mixed feelings about design education. I’m really glad I learnt to kern from old Swiss dudes with white beards, but my uni didn’t prepare me at all for the work I’m doing now. That’s cool, I <em>learnt to learn</em>. I often find myself thinking designers should be taught to <em>design</em> in uni rather than how to be <em>web</em> designers because of the fluidity of our industry and the pace of change, but people like Tiago and Chris Murphy are exciting me about what we can do if we stop trying to adapt graphic design courses to the digital era and instead tailor courses from the ground up to be representative of the industry. Anyway, bigger blog post for another time. If any design schools want a guest lecturer with a rad moustache and an equal penchant for Akzidenz Grotesk and JavaScript, [get in touch](mailto: <a href=\\\"mailto:icanspeak@designedbygold.com\\\">icanspeak@designedbygold.com</a>).</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/jon-billboards-and-novels\\\">Jon Tan</a> got me excited about typography all over again. Great talk and some really insightful (but easy to understand) scientific research on readability &amp; aesthetics mixed in with gifs of elephants on trampolines. Want to finish writing this post so I can go and kern something.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/seb-new-adventures-in-code\\\">Seb Lee-Delisle</a> made everyone in the audience want to code. Brilliant and engaging talk (with live coding on a Commodore64 and in JS!); also great insight into the power of being a hybrid (something I’m very passionate about) and doing work you want to do. Would love to do one of his <a href=\\\"http://seb.ly/training\\\">training courses</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/steph-the-beauty-in-the-impermanent\\\">Steph Troeth</a> spoke about Wabi-Sabi and looking to make our work adapt to an era of impermanence. The stuff we do is in constant flux; an iteration might only be live for a few weeks, or we might have a CMS dealing with 5 years of content. Our work should get better with age and we should adapt to change.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/wayne-wayne-tells-it-like-it-is\\\">Wayne Hemingway</a> gave a hilarious account of how he got rich by taking risks, standing up for what he believes in, and banning French people from his events.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://branch.com/b/wayne-wayne-tells-it-like-it-is\\\">Jessica Hische</a> was a great way to finish off the day (and to close New Adventures for good?). Similar in tone to Michael’s talk earlier in the day, Jessica was talking about doing the work we love to do (and that people will pay us to do!). Made me realise how lucky we are to be able to do stuff we love every day; this industry is amazing. Also talking about side-projects, burn-out, balance, inspiration and cats.</p>\\n<p>Rad, so those were the talks. I need to finish this post so I can design something, brain exploding with awesomeness just thinking about yesterday (and flashbacks of the past few years).</p>\\n<p>A couple of other points…</p>\\n<p><strong>Women in tech.</strong> I’ve always thought #naconf has had a great demographic mix (especially compared to other conferences); this year there were noticeably even more women there than years past. This is good news; this is progress. Anecdotally, my girlfriend reported having to queue for the toilets for the first time ever at a web conference so I guess there are downsides. Anyway…</p>\\n<p>On a personal note, New Adventures has been a hugely important part of my career and my development as a designer. The first one in 2011 was the first time I met lots of the people I’m lucky enough to call friends and colleagues now, and the first time I really felt part of the web design community. The events have always been excellent, and if this is the last one then they’ve definitely gone out on a high. Colly and Greg — if you’ve bothered to read this far down; thanks guys :)</p>\\n<p>Last thing — there was a bit of an incident involving two men, a piano and a hefty repair bill. If you could <a href=\\\"http://www.indiegogo.com/helpcollyandgreg\\\">spare a couple of quid</a> to help out Colly &amp; Greg that would be awesome.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2013/01/New-Adventures.md\n ** module id = 439\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Designing Open Source\",\"layout\":\"link\",\"date\":\"2013-04-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"external_url\":\"https://medium.com/words-about-design/designing-open-source-e3adc220cfa7\",\"body\":\"\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2013/04/designing-open-source.md\n ** module id = 440\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Insatiable Curiosity\",\"layout\":\"link\",\"date\":\"2013-04-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\"external_url\":\"https://medium.com/@jongold/insatiable-curiosity-a23254f8b75e\",\"body\":\"\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2013/04/insatiable-curiosity.md\n ** module id = 441\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Everyone Does Everything\",\"layout\":\"link\",\"date\":\"2013-05-31T00:00:00.000Z\",\"external_url\":\"https://medium.com/words-about-design/everyone-does-everything-12e0882c51d1\",\"body\":\"\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2013/05/everyone-does-everything.md\n ** module id = 442\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Little Big Wins\",\"layout\":\"link\",\"date\":\"2013-05-28T00:00:00.000Z\",\"external_url\":\"https://medium.com/words-about-design/little-big-wins-d7f4fa67de64\",\"body\":\"\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2013/05/little-big-wins.md\n ** module id = 443\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"date\":\"2013-07-17\",\"layout\":\"link\",\"title\":\"Meet HireMyFriend\",\"published\":true,\"header-img\":\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/proxy/0*7t0yjVF0Bu-YpmzJ.png\",\"external_url\":\"https://medium.com/@jongold/meet-hiremyfriend-a-new-product-from-makeshift-372c64f3d833\",\"body\":\"<p>Today we’re really excited to share our latest product with you —\\n<a href=\\\"http://hiremyfriend.io/\\\">HireMyFriend</a>. You can check it out right now, but\\nfirst I’d like to tell you a little about why we’ve made it.</p>\\n<h3>#startuplife</h3>\\n<p>A couple of months ago a friend came to me with a problem. The startup she\\nworked at was imploding—as they do—and she needed to find a new job. She is a\\nrespected designer with a whole bunch of Twitter followers and LinkedIn\\nconnections that she could usually reach out to for leads, but in this case\\ncouldn’t.</p>\\n<p>When you’re in a full-time job and need to find new work, it’s really\\ndifficult to reach out for help.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Hey guys, I’m looking for work as a visual designer. I’m London based and\\ncan start from Monday”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><strong>If you tweeted that you’d get fired!</strong> You have to have some tact; unfortunately this usually just means silence. Sneakily emailing your confidants is risky and time consuming; even updating your LinkedIn profile looks suspicious. That network you can usually rely on for favours in a time of need? Gone.</p>\\n<p>Over the next few months I noticed this recurring trend. <strong>My friends who work\\nas freelancers would blissfully tweet out their availability</strong>—which I’m more\\nthan happy to pass around—whilst my friends in full-time jobs tip-toed around\\nand only revealed their career intentions in hushed whispers.</p>\\n<p>There would be occasional private messages: <em>“Hey, do you know anyone hiring?\\nPlease don’t tweet about it!”</em>, and public tweets saying <em>“My friend is\\nlooking for work”</em>, but that seems like a slow &amp; disjointed way of finding\\nopportunities.</p>\\n<p><strong>The web is revolutionising the way we look for work</strong>—and as employers, the way we find talented people to work with—but lots of people are left out of this process.</p>\\n<h3>A little help from our friends.</h3>\\n<p>We want everyone to find a job they love and we want to avoid awkward\\nsituations in the job search process. We want to give full-time employees the\\nsame freedom to move around that freelancers enjoy. And we want to make job\\nsearches social.</p>\\n<p>At <a href=\\\"http://makeshift.io/\\\">Makeshift</a>, we started prototyping tools to make\\nthis a thing of the past, which brings us to today.</p>\\n<p>Introducing <a href=\\\"http://hiremyfriend.io/\\\">HireMyFriend</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*kO6Ge2Ww7wzkvg5G.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Create a profile</strong>.

They’ll give you an endorsement and—if you ask nicely—share your profile for you.</p>\\n<p>You know your friend who just wrote a book that everyone is talking about? Ask\\nher. Or your friend who has a zillion Twitter followers? Ask him! <strong>Get people\\ntalking!</strong></p>\\n<p>Recommendations from the right people will get employers excited.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/0*efkA2cQPybrITLiv.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Employers get in touch</strong>.

It’s been a good ride — I’ve made a <a href=\\\"http://hiremyfriend.io\\\">whole</a> <a href=\\\"http://attending.io\\\">load</a> <a href=\\\"http://helpmewrite.co\\\">of</a> <a href=\\\"http://listerly.co/\\\">awesome</a> <a href=\\\"https://dribbble.com/shots/1029671-Bitsy-Homepage?list=users&amp;offset=11\\\">products</a> (and in doing so registered most of the .io domains on the internet), met &amp; worked with amazing people, and grown immeasurably as a designer &amp; programmer.</p>\\n<p>But all good things must come to an end. At Makeshift my involvement with new product prototyping has slowed down as we focus on growing our existing products; the team of generalist hackers slowly giving way to talented specialists. That’s the nature of startup teams, though. As much as I love Makeshift our paths have been diverging for a while and I think this is as good a point as any to disembark the startup strugglebus and ride off into the distance in the muscle car of doing-my-own-thing.</p>\\n<h2>:enew</h2>\\n<p>What’s the plan? At least in the short term I’ll be doing freelance design &amp; development - hopefully with small startups where I can add the most value.</p>\\n<p>The timing couldn’t be better. In the past few months it seems like all of my talented friends have left their full-time jobs in search of the freedom freelancing brings. The London product design scene has become close knit over the past year and this is a great time to collaborate with people I’ve wanted to work with for ages. I suspect there will be lots of shared projects, knowledge, and most importantly, beers.</p>\\n<p>I’ll also be setting aside time to build my own products. It’s been super gratifying seeing real people get real jobs through <a href=\\\"http://hiremyfriend.io\\\">Hire my Friend</a>; since we started building it last June I’ve had a bunch of other ideas I’ve been desperate to build but that I could neither do justice working on in the evenings nor fit into Makeshift’s product roadmap. That’s all going to change - there will be some exciting new bits of internet coming soon and I’m excited to share them with you.</p>\\n<h2>Available for websites, apps, conferences, weddings &amp; bar mitzvahs.</h2>\\n<p>Business time. You can hire me for design and front-end, Ruby, JavaScript &amp; iOS development. I’ve been doing lots of early-stage product design &amp; development recently—if you need help getting an MVP out the door, I could be your guy—but am equally up for doing new things around data visualisation, experimental interfaces and just good old fashioned graphic design!</p>\\n<p>I’ll have some availability in May, and am wide-open from June onwards; <a href=\\\"mailto:hire@designedbygold.com\\\">say hi and let’s make things happen</a>. I’m not looking to jump back into a full-time job immediately, but would love to hear from you if you think I’d be a good fit for your company anyway.</p>\\n<p>Rad, I think that’s all. Sad to be leaving Makeshift, but they’re in better shape than ever with some great new additions to the team and new features coming out soon across all the products.

Posterity and all that.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://news.layervault.com/stories/27897-static-vs-cms-whats-the-best-solution-for-clients\\\">Tonight on DesignerNews</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>There was a post earlier today about whether or not people still build static sites for their clients. That discussion begs the question, if not static then what?\\nThere’s a wide range of ‘CMS’ options out there from database-driven solutions like WordPress and Drupal to static site generators like Jekyll and Middleman. WordPress and Drupal can be easy for clients to update once they are set up, but there is a ton of associated overhead. Jekyll and Middleman are dead simple, but require some knowledge of command line and markdown to redeploy after making changes.\\nWhen dealing with clients building stuff like landing and marketing pages what is your preferred solution? What’s the perfect balance between usability for the client and ease of development?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A better CMS, I think. I really don’t know the answer, but I want to kill myself working with WordPress or Drupal - so whilst the client might enjoy the editing interface, they won’t be getting a website to edit because they won’t have a web designer by that point.</p>\\n<p>Jekyll is fantastic but obviously it’s not perfect for non-technical users. Things like <a href=\\\"http://Prose.io\\\">Prose.io</a> are cool but they still don’t tell the whole story - they’re great for editing <em>text</em> but CMS’s aren’t just about editing text - they’re about reviewing drafts and installing plugins and doing <em>adminy stuff</em> - letting people feel like they’re in control.</p>\\n<p>I don’t think Jekyll is great because it’s a static site generator - it’s great because it has a sane API, where the alternatives have mindnumbingly awful APIs. I’d keep an eye on Ghost and Buckets - I don’t think the CMS is dead, just that the incumbents are shitshows.</p>\\n<p>The caveat is the death of CMSs for small, personal sites for technical owners. Remember years ago when every designers’ portfolio site was a sprawling WordPress/Drupal/Joomla/PHP Nuke/Mambo/kill-me-now mess? Every post was a database entry in a MySQL database you had no idea how anything really worked and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ALL YOU WANTED TO DO WAS LOOP OVER SOME IMAGES? Jekyll solves that; there’s no need for a CMS for that junk.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>(He blogs, from Jekyll via <a href=\\\"http://Prose.io\\\">Prose.io</a>)</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2014/07/death-of-the-cms.md\n ** module id = 446\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"layout\":\"post\",\"published\":true,\"date\":\"2014-07-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\"title\":\"Skyscrapers & Sandcastles\",\"body\":\"<p>There are two ways to build digital products — sandcastles or skyscrapers. They’re both effective, but care should be taken when mixing them.</p>\\n<h2>Sandcastles</h2>\\n<p>Sandcastles are great for prototyping ideas. Whether it’s a weekend hackathon project, an afternoon messing around in a REPL, or a two week ‘JFDI’ sprint, it’s really powerful to be able to just get things out of your head, into a browser and in front of users.</p>\\n<p>The CSS may be gross, the errors not handled and Ruby a little janky, but if you’re clear about <strong>why</strong> you’re hacking, hacking is a great tool to have. The quicker you can build, the quicker you can validate your ideas, and tight feedback loops are critical to making great products. Sandcastles don’t mind when they get washed away by the tide at the end of the day.</p>\\n<p>Everything we built at <a href=\\\"http://makeshift.io\\\">Makeshift</a> started out in this way - a hack that we built quickly and showed to users as soon as possible.</p>\\n<h2>Skyscrapers</h2>\\n<p>That’s not to say that all products should start out as hacks. <em>Actually building things properly</em> also has it’s place. This is a weird paragraph to write, actually — I didn’t think I’d ever have to justify writing good code. But yeah. Some things you have to build properly to start with. Everything else should really end up being built properly <em>eventually</em>. There comes a point where you actually need things tested. You need modular, reusable code - a codebase that Google won’t laugh at when they inevitably acquihire you.</p>\\n<p>And it’s that transition between the two that’s the difficult thing to manage.</p>\\n<h2>“No total rebuilds”</h2>\\n<p>So much has been written on the painful death-march that accompanies ground-up rebuilds of existing products. There will be day-long sprint planning meetings and a grumpy Product Manager yelling at you all the time and…</p>\\n<p>Yup, not fun. Total rebuilds of big legacy products are a massive pain. But there’s one time that they’re justified.</p>\\n<h2>Skyscrapers built on sandcastles</h2>\\n<p>In an early-stage startup, one of the surest ways to acquire a big, ganky, legacy codebase is to build a skyscraper on top of your sandcastle.</p>\\n<p>After two weeks of heads-down hacking, you post <em><a href=\\\"http://InstaYoDogBook.io\\\">InstaYoDogBook.io</a></em> on <a href=\\\"http://www.producthunt.co/\\\">Product Hunt</a>. The upvotes roll in. Dave Morin liked it; you get a one-sentence email from a VC. They want to give you 15 squillion dollars for 80% of your company. You get written up on TechCrunch, and some compromising photos from university get posted to ValleyWag. Success!</p>\\n<p>Great scenario. Traction! People like your app! Let’s keep #hustling, right?</p>\\n<p>Maybe you take a week or two off from the codebase to #GetOutOfTheBuilding and #TalkToUsers and #DoMoreLeanStuff. This goes well. Back to the code. There are bugs to squash and #JobsToBeDone to, er, be done.</p>\\n<p>Fire up Vim. Shit. You realise that your first 10 000 users are all logging in through a 30 line <code>if</code> statement. That’s never going to hold up! What idiot wrote it? <code>git blame</code>. You did, apparently, but you have no recollection of it. Commit time? 4am. Commit blood-Red Bull level? Lots, probably. You look around, and the whole app is built like this. Who built that thing there? You did, too. Actually, you were being super lean and hacky and built the whole thing, it’s all your fault.</p>\\n<p>This is your sandcastle. What you’ve done is built a very, very brittle product, very quickly. Your sandcastle was absolutely perfect for what you wanted when you were just trying to get something built before the tide came in, but it’s ill-equipped for your needs as you grow the product. How does any of this work? Why on <em>earth</em> did you call that variable <code>foo</code> and forget to rename it? This isn’t fun! Where do you go from here?</p>\\n<p>Write some friggin’ tests, dummy! (Unless you’re DHH, in which case move swiftly along). You try—you try so hard—to pull the app back into a state which is manageable to build on. Add <code>rspec</code> and a bunch of trendy testing bits to your <code>Gemfile</code>. Every new class should have a Single Responsibility and follow the Law of Demeter and have descriptive method names and…you get the point. You turn over a new digital leaf and promise to do everything right in future.</p>\\n<p>But things won’t change, I promise. Good code can’t be written on top of bad code, skyscrapers can’t be be built upon sandcastles. Validation is the most important thing when you’re building a product, but once you’ve got that you have to be ruthless and optimise for developer productivity. No one wants to work on a 2-month-old insta-legacy app.</p>\\n<p>The good thing about being a few weeks or months into a product versus a 5 year old behemoth, though, is that you can quickly &amp; cheaply throw away everything you’ve done and do it again, properly, when the time is right.</p>\\n<p>Don’t build skyscrapers when sandcastles will suffice, but when you move onto a skyscraper down the road, make sure you kick over that sandcastle and start again.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2014/07/skyscrapers-sandcastles.md\n ** module id = 447\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Selfies\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"date\":\"2014-09-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\"published\":true,\"body\":\"<p>He opens Twitter and taps away at his keyboard.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“It would be really great if amazing designers and developers would work on meaningful things instead of yet more selfie apps”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>His finger lingers over the <em>send</em> button.

That’s understandable — the website has a screenshot of a Mac app, a download button, and a caption saying ‘available for Mac’. Here’s the thing — you can use Framer and join this wonderful community &amp; way of working on <em>any platform</em>. Let me explain…</p>\\n<p>The app you see in the screenshots on the <a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/\\\">Framer website</a> is ‘Framer Studio’. It’s a paid app, for OSX only. The thing that powers it though—Framer.js—is open source, and available for free on GitHub.</p>\\n<p>To save you having to compile the source, Framer provide a simple <a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/static/downloads/Framer.zip\\\">.zip file</a> to get you started - including all of the JavaScript you need, and an HTML file to open in your browser. It’s that simple to get started with Framer on Windows or Linux!</p>\\n<h2>So what’s Framer Studio? Where’s that lovely UI?</h2>\\n<p>Framer Studio is a collection of tools around Framer.js itself. Some of these are unique, some of them you can replicate yourself on <em>any computer</em>. It won’t be as smooth as using Framer Studio on a Mac, but certainly easier than making a trip to the Apple Store.</p>\\n<p>Some of the notable features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>CoffeeScript compilation</li>\\n<li>LiveReload</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>More on those in a second. Some features that you can get an approximation of in  any editor (e.g. <a href=\\\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\\\">Sublime Text</a>):</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Syntax highlighting</li>\\n<li>Snippets</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/awt2542/SublimeCompletionFramerjs\\\">Autocomplete</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And then some more nifty things that are unique to the Mac app:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Templates</li>\\n<li>Sharing</li>\\n<li>Presentation view</li>\\n<li>Mirror</li>\\n<li>Zoom</li>\\n<li>Sketch/Photoshop importing</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Framer Studio is definitely <strong>optional</strong>, but the features you get are <strong>really nice</strong>.</p>\\n<p>With that said: CoffeeScript!</p>\\n<h2>Why does my code break when I try to run the examples from the website?</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/static/downloads/Framer.zip\\\">That link</a> you just download is in <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Framer Studio, and all of the examples on the website, are in <strong>CoffeeScript</strong>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://coffeescript.org/\\\">CoffeeScript</a> is a version of JavaScript with a bunch of nifty features, but most importantly for us, it gets rid of a bunch of brackets. JavaScript <strong>needs_</strong> those brackets.</p>\\n<p>For example, the first page of <a href=\\\"http://framerjs.com/learn/basics/\\\">Framer Basics</a> shows you how to create a simple layer.</p>\\n<pre><code>layerA = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Layer\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  x:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">y:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">width:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">height:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If you try to add that to the <code>app.js</code> file you downloaded, you’ll be confronted with some nasty errors. In JavaScript it should look more like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>var layerA = new Layer({\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  x:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>,\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  y:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>,\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  width:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>,\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-symbol\\\">  height:</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Not too different, but enough to make your web browser complain! Let’s look at a more complex example and then I’ll show you how to fix it :)</p>\\n<pre><code>layerA<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span> \\n  properties:\\n    x:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">200</span>\\n  curve: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n\\nlayerA<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.on</span> Events<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.AnimationEnd</span>, -&gt;\\n  layerA<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span>\\n    properties:\\n      x:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n    curve: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In JavaScript that would be more like</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">layerA</span><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span>({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">properties</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">x</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">200</span>\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">curve</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n});\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">layerA</span><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.on</span>(Events.AnimationEnd, function() {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">layerA</span><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-class\\\">.animate</span>({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">properties</span>: {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">x</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n    },\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">curve</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ease-in-out\\\"</span>\\n  });\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>At this point, there’s a few things you could do.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You could translate every line of CoffeeScript you read on the Framer website &amp; in other peoples’ code into JavaScript in your head.</li>\\n<li>You could use a website like <a href=\\\"http://js2.coffee/\\\">JS2Coffee</a> and get it to translate itself, then copy &amp; paste that into your project.</li>\\n<li>Or, you can just set up CoffeeScript on your PC.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I really recommend the third option. If you’re a relative newcomer to JavaScript, you don’t need the added hassle of hoping your code matches up to the code you’re reading in a tutorial. It’s much nicer to use the same language as the rest of the community.</p>\\n<p>Luckily, it’s pretty easy to get it all wired up.</p>\\n<h2>The easy way</h2>\\n<p>Whilst there’s nothing like Framer Studio for Windows or Linux, there are some other nice apps that can help us out.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://prepros.io/\\\">Prepros</a> is available for Windows, Linux &amp; Mac, and helps you compile CoffeeScript (as well as Sass, LESS, Jade &amp; others — you can use this for lots of projects besides Framer). To get started, install &amp; open the app, then add the <code>Project</code> folder from the .zip you downloaded earlier.</p>\\n<p>Next, rename <code>app.js</code> to <code>app.coffee</code>, and replace its contents with some CoffeeScript. Here’s what it converts to:</p>\\n<pre><code>iconLayer = new Layer width:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">256</span>, height:<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">256</span>, image:<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"images/icon.png\\\"</span>\\niconLayer.center()\\n\\n# Define a <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">set</span> of <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">states with names (the original state is</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">'default'</span><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">)</span>\\niconLayer.states.add\\n  second: {y:100, scale:0.6, rotationZ:100}\\n  third:  {y:300, scale:1.3, blur:4}\\n  fourth: {y:200, scale:0.9, blur:2, rotationZ:200}\\n\\n# <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">Set</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">the default animation options</span>\\niconLayer.states.animationOptions <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">=</span>\\n  curve: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"spring(500,12,0)\\\"</span>\\n\\n# On <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">a click, go to the next state</span>\\niconLayer.on <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">Events.Click, -&gt;</span>\\n  iconLayer.states.next()\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then…</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Drag your folder into Prepros.</li>\\n<li>Click on <code>app.coffee</code></li>\\n<li>Make sure ‘auto compile’ is checked</li>\\n<li>Click ‘process file’</li>\\n<li>Click ‘Live preview’ in the toolbar</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Your browser should open, and your prototype should be running. From there, change anything you want to in <code>app.coffee</code> and your browser should magically reload.</p>\\n<p>There are some other options for compiling Coffeescript on Windows - feel free to use another GUI if that’s what you do already, but Prepress is pretty great for an open source tool.</p>\\n<p>You could also go for more fine-grained control by compiling your Coffeescript etc yourself with something like <code>gulp</code> or <code>grunt</code>, but remember, the goal is to be prototyping as quickly as possible, not getting bogged down in tool configuration :)</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2015/05/framer-for-pc.md\n ** module id = 450\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"layout\":\"post\",\"published\":true,\"date\":\"2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"title\":\"Functional Programming, CSS, and your sanity\",\"body\":\"<p>Learning Clojure and/or Haskell will make you a better programmer. Even if you don’t use it day to day, there are a ton of prescient lessons to be taken back to your language of choice.</p>\\n<p>Functional programming is infectious. I find it beautiful &amp; elegant in much the same way as a <a href=\\\"http://dieterrams.tumblr.com/\\\">Braun watch</a> or Karl Gerstner’s grid system for <a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/watz/2382027037/sizes/l/\\\">Capital magazine</a>. Good design (my preferred school of good design, at least) is mathsy, rational and pure—and CSS is design—so it follows that there are a bunch of lessons we can bring back from FP land into design.</p>\\n<p>I’ve been meaning to write this post for months but technical blogging takes me ages — excuse the brain dump.</p>\\n<p>These ideas have been swirling around for a few years; shout out to <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/jxnblk\\\">Brent Jackson</a> and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mrmrs_\\\">Adam Morse</a> for shipping something incredible in <a href=\\\"http://www.basscss.com/\\\">Basscss</a> &amp; <a href=\\\"http://tachyons.io/\\\">Tachyons</a> respectively, whilst I’ve been sitting and thinking about it.</p>\\n<h1>f(css) is:</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Functional</strong>. Small, clear, easy to read classes that are easy to apply and do one thing. You might have called them ‘utility classes’ with some snark, but they rock. A random example from Basscss would be the margin &amp; padding classes - <code>mb1</code>, <code>px2</code> (margin-bottom-1, padding-x-2) etc. The super short naming conventions are optional (I just love Brent’s implementation) — I guess you could write a library with less terse class names if you’re a masochist, but FP seems to tend toward short variable names. When you consolidate all of your sizing &amp; spacing into reusable classes you <em>force</em> a beautiful type scale &amp; rhythm on your design. Neat!</li>\\n<li><strong>Composable</strong>. In FP it’s fun to compose a bunch of small functions together to create larger actions. The parallel in f(css) is building up big ol’ chains of tiny classes. Think declarative composition — <code>&lt;a class=&quot;mb2 bg-green white px2 rounded&quot;&gt;</code> rather than OO-derived objects &amp; modifiers — <code>&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn--primary&quot;&gt;</code>. Scared of writing lots of classes? No shit, everyone hates typing. Wrap them up in React components to your heart’s content. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames\\\">classnames</a> is a fun module for dynamically composing groups of classes, so you don’t end up with massive strings all over the shop. <strong>The point isn’t to get away from component-based <em>design</em></strong> (which rocks and should be a cornerstone of your design ethos); rather you should get away from component-based CSS, which is crappy and repetitive.</li>\\n<li><strong>Immutable</strong>. On to the fun stuff. Declare a property once and you should be damn sure it’s never going to get overwritten. Fuck specificity. Apply the class you want — margin-bottom, say — and rest assured that no one else’s CSS is going to override it. The problem here is that CSS isn’t immutable (has anyone made an actually-immutable CSS preprocessor? If not I’m going to write one), but be clever in your implementation and it’s <em>kind of like immutability</em>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Referentially transparent</strong>. This is a fancy way of saying ‘it should be guaranteed to do the thing you want it to do’. The cascade and ems are two of the worst things about CSS. I’m tired of playing guesswork because some framework author decided that using multipliers was a good idea.</li>\\n<li><strong>Side-effect free</strong>. not only should a class do the same thing every time, but it should never, ever change anything other than what you’re targeting.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I’m aware that this is almost the polar opposite of both OOCSS/SMACSS, and everything that some semantic web bore told you off for doing once upon a time, but I think this is the future of CSS. It’s easy to reason about, quick to write, lightning fast for browsers to parse, and gets rid of the clusterfuck that is the ‘C’ in CSS.</p>\\n<p>Tweet me if you massively disagree, I’ve fudged an FP metaphor, you’ve built an immutable CSS processor, or you think CSS class names should be machine-readable (lol).</p>\\n<p>edit: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/4lpine\\\">John Otander</a> is working on a linter for immutable CSS.
