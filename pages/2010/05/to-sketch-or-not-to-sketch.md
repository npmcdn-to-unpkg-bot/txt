To generalise for a second, I think this is one of the biggest differences between self-taught and formally-educated designers. In university no matter how good your work is, without a thorough collection of sketchbooks to back it up you will fail.

I'm not sure how I feel about this - in the past I have found sketching for its own end (i.e. to please a tutor) a barrier, because I come up with concepts quicker than I can visualise them on paper. On the other hand I think it is a necessary part of the creative process.

Of course for a quick logo or flyer you don't need multiple sketchbooks like you'd fill in a several months long project, but I don't think you're doing yourself justice by not sketching.

I'm not suggesting those who don't sketch don't research or properly think out concepts, but to bring GTD in to it, by dumping those thoughts on paper you're freeing your mind to think more clearly.
