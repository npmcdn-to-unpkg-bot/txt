This is a post I thought I’d never write. I just installed the [developer preview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516) of Windows 8 and really like it.

The thing is, Windows 8 is a very impressive operating system. Shockingly good, if you consider the low standard we expect from Microsoft. **Metro is utterly gorgeous**. I fundamentally disagree with Apple's descent into skeumorphism. I disagree with the principles behind it and the way I see their interfaces going in the next 5-10 years. On the other hand **Metro is fresh and bold**, but most importantly it looks like something one of my favourite designers would have created. **It's straight out of 1960s Switzerland**, but rather than falling into the trap of being too flat and too rigid an interpretation of 60s Modernism, the whole thing feels clickable, touchable and interactable. It's a balance I've struggled with for as long as I've been designing interfaces, so I can appreciate the solution they've presented.

It neatly avoids the trap that Apple and Android UIs have fallen into - hinting at depth is fine, but descending into a clusterfuck of of faux-leather textures, glossy buttons and redundant metaphors is taking it too far.


### But wasn't Windows Phone 7 a bit shit?


Yup. I've admired Metro for a while, but found it to be too ambitious for a smartphone. It just feels cluttered on a 4" screen. Or maybe it was just badly implemented. **There was a huge disparity from looking at the beautiful screenshots and actually using it.** What does this mean for WP7? That's not within the scope of this blogpost. On a 10" tablet though, with more room to let the design breathe? **This could be a serious competitor for the 'lounging on the sofa checking Twitter' category.**


### What about Aero?


I can appreciate a juggernaut like Microsoft being afraid of alienating users with a rapid change of direction. I don't like it, but I can appreciate their business goals. I think there will have to be some future iteration of Windows with Aero in it. **But I don't see the dual-interface thing working out well for them - it presents too many compromises in hardware performance and interface usability**. It shows that Microsoft didn't learn from a decade of unsellable 'tablet' devices. With that said, Aero does look a little nicer than on Windows 7. Perhaps they should release an updated Aero as Windows 7.5.


### Bi-interfacing ≠ #winning.


Switching between two interfaces just isn't going to work. Not for a tablet OS. Click targets and tap targets are too different.

[Gruber made an interesting point the other day](http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/metro) - perhaps on desktop you'll have both Metro and Aero; on tablet devices just Metro. That would be fantastic. I wouldn't use a desktop version of Windows any time soon, but in the event that they really nailed the tablet ecosystem I could see myself trading my iPad for a Windows tablet for casual use.

If they get rid of Aero on tablets they'll have a shot at producing cheap, light tablets with modest hardware and excellent battery life.


### So you think Microsoft is going to whoop Apple's ass?


Nope. My spidey-sense is telling me **Microsoft is organisationally incapable of doing anything exceptional**. They've hired some fantastic designers but I just don't see them working as a team to create a great product. The design teams are only a tiny blip in MSFT's organisational structure, and there are too many potential conflicts of interest that will prevent them from creating a beautiful and pure OS. **Godforbid they make a Metro-style Ribbon…**

The other reason is fragmentation. Without a full-stack offering to compete with Apple (or soon, Google-Motorola) it will still be Windowsy. **Things will still break**. Asian OEMs will still release shitty hardware, and that shitty hardware will work like shit with Windows 8.

Let's not forget why we made (and enjoyed) the switch to Macs -** it wasn't that OS9/X was prettier than Windows** (arguably the first few iterations of OSX were ugly as sin compared to the more restrained XP) - **it was that Macs just worked**, and we were sick of .dll files, registry entries and things breaking on PCs.

**And that's the most important thing Apple still has going for it, because they can't rely on their interfaces any more.**

If you have Windows 8 installed I'd love to know your thoughts in the comments!
