I've freed up ~an hour/day in my calendar to help advise early-stage startups and young designers â€” [Office Hours](http://officehours.tv/) style. I chose the time slot 4pm GMT to be convenient for a range of time zones - that's 8am in SF and 11am in NYC.

I'll see how it goes and tweak as necessary, but for now if you're a pre-money startup, or a (prospective?) design school student feel free to RSVP to one of these slots with your Skype or iChat username and we'll go from there!
