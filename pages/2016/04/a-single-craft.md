In [The Media Lab: Inventing The Future at
MIT](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38276.The_Media_Lab), [Stewart
Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) talks about [Nicholas
Negroponte’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte) vision for the
founding of the Lab:

> all communication technologies are suffering a joint metamorphosis, which can
> only be understood properly if treated as a single subject, and only advanced
> properly if treated as a single craft. The way to figure out what needs to be
> done is through exploring the human sensory and cognitive system and the ways
> that humans most naturally interact. Join this and you grasp the future.

There are clear parallels between this and my own subset of interests in the
world of design, technology, human-computer interaction & artificial
intelligence.

He goes on:

> Negroponte and former MIT President Jerome Wiesner toured and lectured and
> demoed and bargained for seven years, and raised the requisite millions. High
> aluminum walls, countless computers, attractive salaries were generated out of
> tense, soaring proposal words:-“…**New theories about signals, symbols, and
> systems will evolve from the merger of engineering, social science, and the
> arts**.…” “…the intellectual mix of two rapidly evolving and very different
> fields; information technologies and the human sciences.…” “…**a place where
> people will be expected to be equally familiar with lumens, leading, and
> lambda calculus.** Graduates will be required to pursue studies in
> epistemology, experimental psychology, filmmaking, holography, and signal
> processing, as well as in computer science.”

If that sounds familiar, here’s [Walter
Gropius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius) some 65 years prior on
the [foundation of the Bauhaus](http://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/jahre/1919):
> The Bauhaus strives to combine all the arts—sculpture, painting, applied and
> visual art—as inseparable components of a new architecture

It’s a quote that I’ve used several times in
[conference](https://vimeo.com/118895502) [talks](https://vimeo.com/116870994);
I love the sentiment and when I discovered that quote it was great to discover
it from the mouth of one of my design heroes. Similarly I’m electrified by
Negroponte’s remarks: whilst the words are still (slightly) older than me, I
feel even more affinity to the work and ethos of Media Lab than the Bauhaus.

Whilst waving around in the dark trying to find a path, it’s comforting to know
that there is precedent.

A Single Craft.
